Environmental conditions can co-fluctuate over large distances and thereby synchronise primary production in space. However, large-scale studies of such spatiotemporal patterns remain rare in the Arctic, where short time-series and poor spatial replication have characterised the data available on both biotic and abiotic parameters. Here, we use dendrochronological tools to measure ring growth of a dominant dwarf shrub, the polar willowSalix polaris, previously found to reliably trace community-level vascular plant biomass production. We investigated climate drivers of vegetation growth and their role in the synchronisation of primary production across the rapidly warming archipelago of Svalbard (n = 8 sites, composed of 17 sub-sites, 0.06-293 km apart). We found contrasting effects of summer versus winter weather on ring growth and its spatial synchrony. Although an overall positive effect of summer temperature caused spatially synchronous growth, negative impacts of winter rain-on-snow events occurred only locally, potentially counteracting such synchrony. However, the anticipated increase in both summer temperature and spatial extent of rain-on-snow events, causing basal ice encapsulation of the vegetation, could change the relative importance of seasons for spatiotemporal dynamics of shrub growth. Because these shrub ring growth chronologies reflect annual fluctuations in total vascular plant biomass, fuelling the bottom-up controlled food-web, these results have large implications for our understanding of how climate change shapes tundra ecosystem productivity in time and space.","10.1111/oik.07059","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth","growth","Svalbard, NO",79,10,"dendrochronology","summer temperature; summer precipitation; winter precipitation; spring onset timing",4,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","","1","species",""

Their spread is often associated with increases in temperature and other abiotic factors, while variation in habitat moisture and herbivory can mediate the location and rate of this rise in abundance. Much less is known about the mode of increase of arctic shrubs. For one such shrub, Salix glauca, we used microsatellite markers to assess the prevalence of clonal growth (i.e. vegetative spread) and sexual reproduction (i.e. recruitment from seed) at sites with maritime and continental climates and differing in the density of large herbivores. We sampled individuals in plots reflecting the spatial scale of expansion in locations where S. glauca recently increased in abundance. The 400 samples collected across the four sites comprised 310 genotypes. Though evidence of sexual recruitment was common across all sites, coastal sites contained both more and larger clonal genotypes. While we expected soil conditions would be influential, the factors that best predicted the likelihood of clonality, genet size and vascular plant cover, suggest the light environment is of primary importance. Furthermore, in spite of the large distances between sites, there was no suggestion of genetic differentiation into distinct populations. These results indicate that differences in climate and herbivory can influence not only where and how extensively deciduous shrubs spread, but how they are likely to do so. We suggest future research integrating how mode of increase is associated with the rate of spread will advance projections of change in arctic ecosystems.","10.1016/j.ppees.2019.125499","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub reproduction mode","reproduction mode","Sisimiut/Kangerlussuaq, GL",66.98,-53.19,"leaf genetic analysis","continentality; soil moisture; competition",3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,"abiotic & biotic","Salix glauca","1","species",""

With warming and drought during the growing season, insect-driven defoliation is expected to increase in frequency and severity with potential broad-scale impacts on tundra ecosystem functioning. Here we provide the first broad-scale reconstruction of spatio-temporal dynamics of past insect outbreaks by assessing their effects on shrub growth along a typical Greenlandic fjord climate gradient from the inland ice to the sea. Location Nuuk Fjord (64 degrees 30 ' N/51 degrees 23 ' W) and adjacent areas, West Greenland. Taxa Great brocade (Eurois occulta L.) and grey willow (Salix glauca L.). Methods We combined dendro-anatomical and remote sensing analyses. Time series of ring width (RW) and wood-anatomical traits were obtained from chronologies of >40 years established from 153 individuals of S. glauca collected at nine sites. We detected anomalies in satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) related to defoliation and reconstructed past changes in photosynthetic activity across the region. Results We identified outbreaks as distinctive years with reduced RW, cell-wall thickness and vessel size, without being directly related to climate but matching with years of parallel reduction in NDVI. The two subsequent years after the defoliation showed a significant increase in RW. The reconstructed spatio-temporal dynamics of these events indicate substantial regional variation in outbreak intensity linked to the climate variability across the fjord system. Main conclusions Our results highlight the ability of S. glauca to cope with severe insect defoliation by changing carbon investment and xylem conductivity leading to high resilience and rapid recovery after the disturbance.

However, the spatial variability in dwarf shrub growth responses in this remote region remains largely unknown. This study characterizes temperature sensitivity of radial growth of two willow dwarf shrub species from two distinct High Arctic sites. The dwarf shrub Salix arctica from Northern Greenland (82 degrees N), which has a dry continental High Arctic climate, is linked with Salix polaris from central Svalbard (78 degrees N), which experiences a more oceanic High Arctic climate with relatively mild winters. We found similar positive and significant relationships between annual growth of both Salix dwarf shrub species and July-August air temperatures (1960-2010), despite different temperature regimes and shrub growth rates at the two sites. Also, Salix dwarf shrub growth was significantly negatively correlated with Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) indices; S. arctica from Northern Greenland was negatively correlated with previous autumn (AO index) and current summer AO and NAO indices, and S. polaris with the summer NAO index. The results highlight the importance of both local and regional climatic drivers for dwarf willow shrub growth in harsh polar desert habitats and are a step in the direction of identifying and scaling changes in plant growth across the High Arctic.","10.1007/s00484-018-1648-6","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth","growth","Peary Land Peninsula, GL; Svalbard, NO",82.083,32.533,"dendrochronology","annual temperature",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Salix arctica; Salix polaris","2","species",""

Long time series of primary production are rarely available, restricting our mechanistic understanding of vegetation and ecosystem dynamics under climate change. Dendrochronological tools are increasingly used instead, particularly in the Arcticthe world's most rapidly warming biome. Yet, high-latitude plant species are subject to strong energy allocation trade-offs, and whether annual allocations to secondary growth (e.g. tree-rings) actually reflect primary production above-ground remains unknown. Taking advantage of a unique ground-based monitoring time series of annual vascular plant biomass in high Arctic Svalbard (78 degrees N), we evaluated how well retrospective ring growth of the widespread dwarf shrub Salix polaris represents above-ground biomass production of vascular plants. 2. Using a balanced design in permanent plots for plant biomass monitoring, we collected 30 S. polaris shrubs across five sites in each of two habitats. We established annual ring growth time series using linear mixed-effects models and related them to weather records and 13 years of above-ground biomass production in six habitats. 3. Annual ring growth was positively correlated with above-ground biomass production of both S. polaris (r = 0.56) and the vascular plant community as a whole (r = 0.70). As for above-ground biomass, summer temperature was the main driver of ring growth, with this ecological signal becoming particularly clear when accounting for plant, site and habitat heterogeneity. The results suggest that ring growth measurements performed on this abundant shrub can be used to track fluctuations in past vascular plant production of high arctic tundra. 4. Synthesis. Dendrochronological tools are increasingly used on arctic shrubs to enhance our understanding of vegetation dynamics in the world's most rapidly warming biome. Fundamental to such applications is the assumption that annual differences in ring growth reflect between-year variation in above-ground biomass production. We showed that ring growth indeed was a robust proxy for the annual above-ground productivity of both the focal shrub and the vascular plant community as a whole. Despite the challenges of constructing ring growth chronologies from irregularly growing arctic shrubs, our findings confirm that shrub dendrochronology can open new opportunities for community-dynamic studies, including in remote places where annual field sampling is difficult to achieve.","10.1111/1365-2745.13036","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth","growth","Svalbard, NO",77.9,15.2,"dendrochronology","summer temperature; microtopography",2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"abiotic","Salix polaris","1","species",""

For plants, range shifts can only occur via successful recruitment beyond their current distribution limit. However, many environmental and ecological filters can act upon recruitment and establishment, thereby potentially limiting the expected climate-driven shifts. In this study, we investigate potential mechanical and chemical constraints that vegetation above the tall shrubline in alpine and Arctic tundra could impose upon the successful establishment of willow species in the Canadian Western Arctic. We collected willow seeds from an alpine and an Arctic shrubline and conducted germination trials to test (1) for seedbed preferences among three natural and one experimentally scarified seedbeds, and (2) for vulnerability to allelopathic chemicals produced by ericaceous dwarf shrub species. We found that germination was almost four times higher on manually exposed bare ground than on intact, herbaceous vegetation. Seeds of two willow species, Salix arctica and Salix pulchra, were not affected by leaf extracts from dwarf shrubs, Cassiope tetragona and Vaccinum uliginosum, but the germination of Salix richardsonii was reduced by as much as 24% in the presence of chemicals from C. tetragona. Our results suggest that biotic interactions could limit the predicted expansion of tall shrubs in the tundra by interfering with germination. Seemingly species-specific responses highlight the need for replicated studies across a wider range of species combinations. Potential range shifts may not occur as a uniform translocation of the shrubline, but could change the composition of the plant community by filtering out certain species.","10.1007/s00300-018-2355-9","09/09/2020","empirical","willow germination","seedling germination","Qikiqtaruk, CA",69.568,-138.918,"seedling counts","seedbed type; allelopathic compound",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"biotic","Salix arctica; Salix pulchra","3","species",""

Yet, remote-sensing data and retrospective growth analyses of the circumpolar dwarf shrub, Cassiope tetragona, commonly show considerable between-year variability in plant growth in response to variation in summer temperature. Given that both Cassiope growth and vascular plant biomass production share a common environmental driver, summer temperature, we would expect positive co-variation between them. Here we investigate whether this is indeed the case and if so over what spatial scale. LocationMethodsNordenskioldland, high arctic Svalbard. We brought dendroecology and plot-based field estimation methodologies together in an empirical study using retrospective analysis of Cassiope growth and annual estimation of above-ground vegetation biomass production to investigate their temporal and spatial co-variation and sensitivity to summer weather conditions. ResultsConclusionsDespite substantial small-scale heterogeneity, we found spatial co-variation in Cassiope growth patterns, which weakened as distance between sampling sites increased from 0 to 25km. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between annual estimates of above-ground live vascular plant biomass and Cassiope shoot growth over a 12-year period at a local scale. The correlation declined with distance, likely due to increasing differences in local weather conditions. We demonstrate that Cassiope growth can be used as a proxy for above-ground tundra vegetation productivity at the local scale. Our findings suggest that Arctic plant productivity is as sensitive to between-year variation in summer temperature as the well-established growth response of Cassiope. This challenges the view that tundra plant productivity varies little between years and provides a mechanistic understanding that helps reconcile field- and satellite-based annual estimation methods.","10.1111/jvs.12679","09/09/2020","empirical","biomass production","biomass","Svalbard, NO",78.333,15,"dendrochronology; biomass harvest","growth",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"biotic","Cassiope tetragona","1","species",""

The climate dynamics of these regions are important to understand because of large-scale feedbacks to the global climate system. However, little is known about other factors influencing shrub ring growth, possibly obscuring their climate signal. For example, as of yet we are not able to differentiate between herbivory or climatically induced growth depressions. Here, we use one of the most common Arctic shrubs, Alnus viridis as a test case to address this question. We sampled Alnus in Kobbefjord, Greenland, measured shrub-ring width and cell wall thickness and built site chronologies of each parameter. We analysed climate-growth relationships, tested their stability over time and employed a pointer-year analysis to detect growth depressions. We employed bootstrapped transfer function stability tests (BTFS) to assess the suitability of our shrub chronologies for climate reconstruction. Correlations with climate data showed strong significantly positive and stable correlations between summer temperature and ring-width with the exception of the recent decade. A climate reconstruction model failed stability tests, when the complete period of record was used for calibration and verification. Wood anatomy analysis uncovered the occurrence of unusual cell structure (very thin cell walls) in the exceptionally narrow ring of 2004, a recorded insect outbreak year in other parts of Greenland. When excluding the affected ring and a recovery period, the reconstruction model passed all tests, suggesting that the unusual 2004 ring was not climate driven, but rather the result of an insect attack. When combining anatomical analysis with traditional ring-width measurements, we move a step further in potentially distinguishing small rings caused by insect attacks from small rings formed in climatically challenging years. While this study does not provide unambiguous evidence, it does provide potential useful methodological combinations to enable more robust climate reconstructions in areas where climatic records are extremely sparse.","10.1016/j.dendro.2018.02.010","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub ring width","growth","Kobbefjord, GL",64.137,-51.38,"dendrochronology","herbivory",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"biotic","Alnus glutinosa","1","species",""

Conversely, large herbivores have the potential to counteract the positive impacts of climate change on shrub growth. Indeed, by stripping the leaves, herbivores have the potential to control the growth of shrub species and, consequently, limit their expansion. To disentangle the impacts of climate change and herbivory on Betula glandulosa Michx., we conducted a 5-year factorial experiment near Deception Bay, Nunavik, Canada, in which we simulated warmer temperatures, increased nitrogen availability and three caribou browsing intensities during the growing season. At the end of the experiment, we harvested the above-ground biomass of B. glandulosa and conducted dendrochronological analyses on stems. Fertilised plots under ambient temperature had 34% greater shrub biomass than plots assigned to the combined treatment of nitrogen addition and warmer temperatures. Browsing intensity had no effect on final biomass. Nitrogen addition increased radial growth (18%-33%; 3years out of 5). Overall, browsing had a cumulative negative impact on B. glandulosa radial growth during the 5-year experiment. While browsing had no effect in the first year of the experiment, moderate browsing (leaves stripped on 25% of available shoots) decreased radial growth by 27% at year 2, 32% at year 4 and 27% at year 5. Heavy browsing (leaves stripped on 75% of available shoots annually) decreased radial growth by c. 27% at year 2, 37% at year 3, 50% at year 4 and 48% at year 5. We did not observe significant interactions between browsing, temperature and nitrogen availability.Synthesis. Our results clearly showed that caribou browsing may limit the growth of B. glandulosa, and thus can potentially limit its expansion.

The study was conducted in the area of the Fuglebergsletta coastal plain, in the vicinity of the Polish Polar Station (Wedel Jarlsberg Land, SW Spitsbergen). Relationships between the studied phenomenon and basic environmental factors and climate indicators were evaluated. The spatial variation of land surface temperatures (LST) was determined, as were the effects of the physical and chemical properties of soils and the spring melting of snow cover on growth rates. It has been argued that the spatial and seasonal variability of annual growth is determined by the rate at which snow cover disappears and by soil moisture, which determines plants' access to water. Soil moisture depends on soil particle size distribution and weather; it is regulated by the supply of snowmelt water and rainfall as well as by the depth of the top layer of permafrost (thaw depth), which determines the level of groundwater during the growing season. The spatial characteristics of the process of the disappearance of seasonal snow cover are co-determined by the morphology of the substrate and the physical properties of the soil. An important but destructive role is played by thawing episodes, which are increasingly frequent in the winter season, 'rain-on-snow' events, and glaze ice. The values of correlation coefficients indicate a positive role for precipitation and negative influence of temperature. The higher the temperature (along with low precipitation), the lesser the extent of plant growth. The observed trend towards warming in polar areas does not inevitably lead to an increase in biomass production. An increase in temperature during the growing season does not necessarily promote plant growth, but rather indicates drought stress caused by the lowering of groundwater levels related to the increase in thaw depth.","10.1016/j.catena.2017.12.018","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth","growth","Svalbard, NO",77.02,15.32,"dendrochronology","summer temperature; summer precipitation; summer radiation; snow meltout date",4,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Salix polaris; Saxifraga oppositifolia","2","species",""

Most Arctic climate impact studies focus on single factors, such as summer warming, while ecosystems are exposed to changes in all seasons. Through a combination of field and laboratory manipulations, we compared physiological and growth responses of dominant sub-Arctic plant types to midwinter warming events (6 A degrees C for 7 days) in combination with freezing, simulated snow thaw and nitrogen additions. We aimed to identify if different plant types showed consistent physiological, cellular, growth and mortality responses to these abiotic stressors. Evergreen dwarf shrubs and tree seedlings showed higher mortality (40-100%) following extreme winter warming events than Betula pubescens tree seedlings and grasses (0-27%). All species had growth reductions following exposure to - 20 A degrees C, but not all species suffered from - 10 A degrees C irrespective of other treatments. Winter warming followed by - 20 A degrees C resulted in the greatest mortality and was strongest among evergreen plants. Snow removal reduced the biomass for most species and this was exacerbated by subsequent freezing. Nitrogen increased the growth of B. pubescens and grasses, but not the evergreens, and interaction effects with the warming, freezing and snow treatments were minor and few. Physiological activity during the winter warming and freezing treatments was inconsistent with growth and mortality rates across the plants types. However, changes in the membrane fatty acids were associated with reduced mortality of grasses.

However, the extent to which shrubs may benefit from these conditions may be strongly dependent on the following spring climate. Species-specific differences in phenology and spring frost sensitivity likely affect shrub growth responses to warming. Additionally, effects of changes in winter and spring climate may differ over small spatial scales, as shrub growth may be dependent on natural variation in snow cover, shrub density and cryoturbation. We investigated the effects of winter warming and altered spring climate on growing-season performance of three common and widespread shrub species in cryoturbated non-sorted circle arctic tundra. By insulating sparsely vegetated non-sorted circles and parts of the surrounding heath with additional snow or gardening fleeces, we created two climate change scenarios: snow addition increased soil temperatures in autumn and winter and delayed snowmelt timing without increasing spring temperatures, whereas fleeces increased soil temperature similarly in autumn and winter, but created warmer spring conditions without altering snowmelt timing. Winter warming affected shrub performance, but the direction and magnitude were species-specific and dependent on spring conditions. Spring warming advanced, and later snowmelt delayed canopy green-up. The fleece treatment did not affect shoot growth and biomass in any shrub species despite decreasing leaf frost damage in Empetrum nigrum. Snow addition decreased frost damage and stimulated growth of Vaccinium vitis-idaea by c. 50%, while decreasing Betula nana growth (p < .1). All of these effects were consistent the mostly barren circles and surrounding heath. Synthesis. In cryoturbated arctic tundra, growth of Vaccinium vitis-idaea may substantially increase when a thicker snow cover delays snowmelt, whereas in longer term, warmer winters and springs may favour E. nigrum instead. This may affect shrub community composition and cover, with potentially far-reaching effects on arctic ecosystem functioning via its effects on cryoturbation, carbon cycling and trophic cascading.

It is uncertain, however, if this trend will persist in the future. Our study examined growth responses of deciduous shrubs to climate change over the late 20th and early 21st centuries near Kangerlussuaq in western Greenland. We combined shrub dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis and weekly measurements of leaf gas exchange to examine the drivers of secondary growth in two widespread and dominant deciduous shrub species: Salix glauca and Betula nana. Betula showed a dramatic growth decline beginning in the early 1990s, when correlations between growing season air temperature and growth shifted from neutral to strongly negative. Salix also showed a growth decline, but it began slightly later and was more pronounced among older stems. May-August mean air temperature of c. 7 degrees C appeared to be an important threshold. Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) in alpha-cellulose of Salix growth rings declined strongly during the period of reduced growth, suggesting drought-induced stomatal closure as a possible cause. Leaf gas exchange of Salix was also highly sensitive to seasonal variation in moisture availability. Betula growth declined more dramatically than Salix, but leaf gas exchange was less sensitive to moisture availability and there was less evidence of a Delta C-13 trend. We hypothesize that the dramatic Betula growth decline might reflect the combined effects of increasing moisture limitation, repeated defoliation during recent moth outbreaks and greater browsing by a growing muskoxen population.

Here we assess tundra plant community changes along a temperature gradient and how these are modified in the presence of the common allelopathic dwarf shrub Empetrum nigrum and the large herbivore Rangifer tarandus. We developed a structural equation model based on data from a field-based study of 1450 tundra plant communities across Northern Fennoscandia, covering a temperature gradient of 3.5 degrees C, contrasting Rangifer densities, a range of Empetrum abundances in addition to gradients in topography and bedrock. We found temperature to be a significant positive predictor of Empetrum, herbaceous and woody plant abundances. However, the effect of temperature as predictor for herbaceous plant abundance was significantly reduced in communities with Empetrum present. For woody plant abundance Empetrum was a stronger predictor than temperature. In comparison, we found Rangifer density to have marginal or no effect on either herbaceous or woody plant abundance. These findings were not modified by either topography or bedrock. Results from this study indicate that herbaceous plant responses to climate warming are currently reduced in communities where Empetrum is present, whereas the abundance of Empetrum and other woody plants is promoted. Results also indicate that any future Empetrum encroachment is likely to drive tundra communities towards slower process rates and lower biodiversity. As such our results substantiate the importance of understanding the dynamics of niche constructor species and include them in predictive models of climate change.","10.1016/j.ppees.2017.06.005","09/09/2020","empirical / modelling","community composition","abundance","Northern Fennoscandia",NA,NA,"vegetation surveys; SEM","summer temperature; allelopathy; herbivory; topography; geology",5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,"abiotic & biotic","Empetrum nigrum","1","species",""

This encroachment is, however, believed to remain limited to the relatively warm parts of the biome, where taller shrubs may displace shorter species. Still, climate sensitivity of shrub growth strongly differs between species and sites and High Arctic dwarf shrub species may respond rapidly to increasing temperatures in absence of taller species. In addition, it remains largely unknown whether shrubs from different functional groups from the same sites respond similarly to climate drivers. In the present study we examined the climate-growth relationships of six different site-species combinations: one evergreen and one deciduous shrub species at two alpine sites, and one evergreen dwarf shrub species at two High Arctic sites. We compared linear mixed models for each combination, explaining existing shrub growth data with site-specific interpolated monthly and seasonal climate data from the gridded meteorological dataset CRU TS4.00. Shrub growth rates were found to be sensitive to summer climate for all species at all sites. Continued and projected warming is thus likely to stimulate a further encroachment of shrubs in these systems, at least through a densification of existing stands. Dwarf shrub growth strongly responded to the recent warming at both High Arctic sites, contrasting with previous work suggesting that shrub expansion might remain limited to warmer tundra regions. At the alpine sites, growth of evergreen shrubs was found to be more dependent on summer climate than growth of deciduous shrubs, perhaps because these evergreen species are less prone to herbivory. However, biome-wide generalizations at the functional group level may be difficult to interpolate to the species level. Micro-site conditions, such as the determination of growing season length and winter soil temperatures, and influence on growing season soil moisture by snow depth, may determine the strength of the climate-growth relationships found.","10.3112/erdkunde.2018.01.04","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth","growth","Yukon, CA; Jensen Land, GL; Vole, NO; Svalbard, NO",83.2,-33.22,"dendrochronology","temperature; precipitation",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Cassiope tetragona; Salix pulchra; Betula nana; Empetrum nigrum","4","species",""

The direction in which the vegetation shifts will co-determine whether Arctic warming is mitigated or accelerated, making the understanding of successional trajectories urgent. One of the key factors influencing the competitive relationships between plant species is their access to nutrients, depending on the depth where they take up most nutrients.

The absorption of N-15 by grasses, sedges, deciduous shrubs and evergreen shrubs from the three depths was compared. ResultsThe results clearly show a vertical differentiation of N uptake by these plant functional types, corresponding to their rooting strategy. Shallow-rooting dwarf shrubs were more capable of absorbing nutrients from the upper soil than from deeper soil. Deep-rooting grasses and sedges were more capable of absorbing nutrients from deeper soil than the dwarf shrubs. The natural N-15 abundances in control plants also indicate that graminoids can absorb more nutrients from the deeper soil than dwarf shrubs. ConclusionsOur results show that graminoids and shrubs in the Arctic differ in their N uptake strategies, with graminoids profiting from nutrients released at the thaw front, while shrubs mainly forage in upper soil layers.

However, landscapescale patterns and drivers of shrub expansion remain poorly understood, inhibiting accurate incorporation of shrub effects into climate models. Here, we use dendroecology to elucidate the role of soil moisture in modifying the relationship between climate and growth for a dominant deciduous shrub, Salix pulchra, on the North Slope of Alaska, USA. We improve upon previous modeling approaches by using ecological theory to guide model selection for the relationship between climate and shrub growth. Finally, we present novel dendroecology-based estimates of shrub biomass change under a future climate regime, made possible by recently developed shrub allometry models. We find that S. pulchra growth has responded positively to mean June temperature over the past 2.5 decades at both a dry upland tundra site and an adjacent mesic riparian site. For the upland site, including a negative second-order term in the climate-growth model significantly improved explanatory power, matching theoretical predictions of diminishing growth returns to increasing temperature. A first-order linear model fit best at the riparian site, indicating consistent growth increases in response to sustained warming, possibly due to lack of temperature-induced moisture limitation in mesic habitats. These contrasting results indicate that S. pulchra in mesic habitats may respond positively to a wider range of temperature increase than S. pulchra in dry habitats. Lastly, we estimate that a 2 degrees C increase in current mean June temperature will yield a 19% increase in aboveground S. pulchra biomass at the upland site and a 36% increase at the riparian site. Our method of biomass estimation provides an important link toward incorporating dendroecology data into coupled vegetation and climate models.","10.1111/gcb.13677","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth","growth","North Alaska, US",68.67,-149.44,"dendrochronology","summer temperature; soil moisture",2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Salix pulchra","1","species",""

We hypothesize that, being more coupled to ground microclimate, junipers will be less influenced by atmospheric conditions and will less respond to the post-1950 climate warming than coexisting standing trees. Unexpectedly, shrub and tree growth forms revealed divergent growth trends in all the three biomes, with juniper performing better than trees at Mediterranean than at Polar and Alpine sites.

Tall-shrub expansion into low-statured communities, a hallmark of recent vegetative change across tundra ecosystems, involves three major genera: Alnus, Betula and Salix. Which genus expands most into tundra landscapes will determine ecosystem properties. 2. We show that Alnus and Salix shrubs segregate thermal space (elevation 9 insolation) and colonize tundra landscapes differently in response to climate warming, thereby replacing different tundra types. 3. Vegetative change estimated from repeat photography should account for hill-slope. Methodologically, slope determines surface area estimated from orthophotos as projected pixel area times secant of pixel slope. Ecologically, the change in thermally responsive vegetative area is sensitive to terrain steepness, scaling as the cosecant of hill-slope, so that studies should expect more shrub expansion in areas of shallow slopes than steep slopes. 4. Repeat aerial photography in Alaska's Chugach Mountains from 1972 to 2012 orthorectified on a high-resolution lidar digital elevation model indicated tall Salix was rare in 1972 and colonized warmer slopes by 2012. Tall Alnus colonized steeper, cooler slopes both by 2012 and by 1972. Salix and forest colonized similar thermal space. Colonization probability for both shrub genera was maximized at intermediate elevations. 5. Alnus colonization adjacent to dwarf-shrub tundra was twenty times as likely as Salix colonization. Salix colonization adjacent to low-shrub/herbaceous tundra was three times as likely as Alnus colonization. Replacement of dwarf-shrub tundra by Alnus and of low-shrub/herbaceous communities by Salix will affect herbivores and soil properties. 6. Good agreement between observations of plant functional type and multinomial predictions in a thermal space defined by elevation and insolation suggested that these two variables were sufficient for forecast modelling. Spatially explicit, climate-driven generalized linear multinomial and random forest classification models in available thermal space forecast surface areas of forest, Alnus, Salix and tundra over a range of warming, modelled as upward shifted isotherms, including expected IPCC scenarios. Both modelling approaches indicated that shrubs may respond nonlinearly to warming. 7. Synthesis.

This requires recruitment from seed, which currently shows very low rates in arctic regions, where long-lived and vegetatively reproducing plants dominate. Therefore, we pose the question whether recruitment (germination and seedling establishment) in arctic regions will significantly improve in a warmer world, and thus allow species to follow their climatic niche. We used a full factorial experiment to examine if realistic warmer temperatures (+3 degrees C; infrared radiation) and increased nitrogen availability (+1.4 g N m(-2) year(-1)) affected germination, seedling survival and above-and below-ground seedling biomass in five species common in subarctic regions (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Betula nana, Pinus sylvestris, Solidago virgaurea, Vaccinium myrtillus). We found that warming increased seedling emergence in all species, but that subsequent mortality also increased, resulting in no net warming effect on seedling establishment. Warming slightly increased above-ground seedling biomass. Fertilization, on the other hand, did not influence seedling biomass, but it increased seedling establishment in B. nana while it reduced establishment in V. myrtillus. This may help B. nana dominate over V. myrtillus in warmer tundra. Surprisingly, no interactive effects between warming and fertilization were found. The lack of a general positive response of seedling establishment to warmer and more nutrient-rich conditions suggests that (sub) arctic species may experience difficulties in tracking their climatic niche. Predictions of future species distributions in arctic regions solely based on abiotic factors may therefore overestimate species' ranges due to their poor establishment. Also, the opposite response to fertilization of two key (sub) arctic dwarf shrubs, i.e. B. nana and V. myrtillus, could have important implications for the future development of arctic plant communities and argues for more research into the role of fertilization for plant establishment.","10.1093/aobpla/plx040","09/09/2020","empirical","seedling establishment","recruitment","Abisko, SE",86.35,18.817,"transplant experiment","summer temperature; soil nitrogen concentration",2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"abiotic","Betula nana; Vaccinium myrtillus","2","species",""

To determine if a moderate and climatically realistic increase in snow depth can enhance shrub productivity, we compared growth responses between ambient and experimentally deepened snow plots in low birch hummock tundra. To determine the potential influence of factors other than deepened snow that are associated with taller, denser shrubs, we also compared shrub growth between low birch hummock and tall birch-dominated tundra. Neither deciduous shrub above- nor belowground production nor nitrogen accumulation was enhanced by deepened snow. However, deciduous birch shrub new shoot production was 23x larger and total vascular shoot to belowground biomass ratios were higher in the tall birch tundra than the birch hummock (similar to 0.7 and similar to 0.4, respectively), indicating that the combination of deeper snow together with other internal feedbacks greatly enhanced birch growth. Together, our results strongly suggest that the much larger litter production in tall birch ecosystems is an important internal feedback that may or may not interact with deeper snow to promote birch growth in tall shrub tundra.","10.1007/s11104-016-2921-2","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub biomass","biomass; nitrogen concentrations","Northwest Territories, CA",64.867,-111.583,"experiment","snow cover; vegetation type",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,"abiotic & biotic","Betula glandulosa; Vaccinium uliginosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Rhododendron subarcticum","4","species",""

We tested two competing hypotheses. On one hand, we anticipated the cooler, drier soils beneath the Betula canopy could result in greater drought sensitivity in this species.

Our results revealed greater drought sensitivity in Poa, which displayed reductions in A(max) and g(s) during periods of high atmospheric demand and dry soils. Additionally, leaf Delta C-13 and Delta O-18 were negatively correlated in Poa, suggesting strong stomatal influence on Delta C-13. Conversely, there was no relationship between gs and canopy or soil microclimates and no correlation between leaf Delta C-13 and Delta O-18 in Betula, indicating that variation in Delta C-13 may have been driven by variation in photosynthesis.

Our goal was to determine the environments where tall shrubs thrive and use this information to predict the location of future shrub expansion. The study area covers over 80,000 km(2) and has mostly tundra vegetation. Large canopy volumes were uncommon, with volumes over 0.5 m(3)/m(2) present on just 8% of plots. Shrub canopy volumes were highest where mean July temperatures were above 10.5 degrees C and on weakly acid to neutral soils (pH of 6 to 7) with deep summer thaw (>80 cm) and good drainage. On many sites, flooding helped maintain favorable soil conditions for shrub growth. Canopy volumes were highest where the typical snow loss date was near 20 May; these represent sites that are neither strongly wind-scoured in the winter nor late to melt from deep snowdrifts. Individual species varied widely in the canopy volumes they attained and their response to the environmental factors. Betula sp. shrubs were the most common and quite tolerant of soil acidity, cold July temperatures, and shallow thaw depths, but they did not form high-volume canopies under these conditions. Alnus viridis formed the largest canopies and was tolerant of soil acidity down to about pH 5, but required more summer warmth (over 12 degrees C) than the other species.

Here, we present a more than 100years long Betulanana ring-width chronology from Disko Island in western Greenland that demonstrates a highly significant and positive growth response to both summer and winter air temperatures during the past century. The importance of winter temperatures for Betulanana growth is especially pronounced during the periods from 1910-1930 to 1990-2011 that were dominated by significant winter warming. To explain the strong winter importance on growth, we assessed the importance of different environmental factors using site-specific measurements from 1991 to 2011 of soil temperatures, sea ice coverage, precipitation and snow depths. The results show a strong positive growth response to the amount of thawing and growing degree-days as well as to winter and spring soil temperatures. In addition to these direct effects, a strong negative growth response to sea ice extent was identified, indicating a possible link between local sea ice conditions, local climate variations and Betula nana growth rates. Data also reveal a clear shift within the last 20years from a period with thick snow depths (1991-1996) and a positive effect on Betulanana radial growth, to a period (1997-2011) with generally very shallow snow depths and no significant growth response towards snow. During this period, winter and spring soil temperatures have increased significantly suggesting that the most recent increase in Betulanana radial growth is primarily triggered by warmer winter and spring air temperatures causing earlier snowmelt that allows the soils to drain and warm quicker. The presented results may help to explain the recently observed greening of the Arctic' which may further accelerate in future years due to both direct and indirect effects of winter warming.","10.1111/gcb.12913","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth","growth","Disko Island, GL",69.25,-53.517,"dendrochronology","soil temperature; sea ice coverage; precipitation; snow depth",4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Betula nana","1","species",""

Yet, summer weather conditions, which differ greatly among years, are believed to have little direct effect on arctic plant productivity. The dominant view is that between-year variation in aboveground plant biomass is small and poorly related to weather conditions in the same year in the Arctic. Here, we test this view based on a 12-year investigation of peak plant biomass among habitats, plant functional types, and species in high-arctic Svalbard. Our study revealed twofold variation (range 23-46 g/m(2)) in plant biomass between years, this being strongly related to summer temperature (r = 0.92). Importantly, we found strong plant biomass-summer temperature relationships across habitats, plant functional types, and species, and little evidence for a lagged effect of previous year's biomass. Responses were of similar orders of magnitude, indicating that summer weather conditions were the key driver of plant productivity at all three levels of investigation. We propose three key factors behind such tight relationships between summer temperature and plant biomass in the same year. First, our methodological approach, a combination of nondestructive shoot density estimates in small, permanent plots and destructive shoot mass estimates outside these plots, allowed us to overcome the otherwise overwhelming small-scale spatial heterogeneity in aboveground plant biomass typical for high-arctic tundra vegetation. Second, the high-latitude location (78 degrees N) makes the vegetation most susceptible to temperature differences due to their influence on process rates. Third, Svalbard's oceanic nature dictates prevalent cloud cover, making summer temperature a good proxy for light availability and thus an index of photosynthetic activity required for plants to produce biomass. The present study challenges the prevailing notion that relationships between summer weather and vascular plant performance in the Arctic are weak and highly variable among plant species. This has important implications for our understanding of how and at which temporal scales future climate change will shape arctic plant productivity and, in turn, the dynamics of other ecosystem components in the low-productivity, bottom-up regulated ecosystems of the High Arctic.","10.1890/14-0533.1","09/09/2020","empirical","plant biomass","biomass","Svalbard, NO",77,15.333,"monitoring","summer temperature; cloudiness; summer precipitation",3,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Salix polaris; Dryas octopetala","2","species",""

To examine if the physical effects associated with the construction, maintenance, and use of gravel roads alter vegetation and permafrost conditions, we measured vegetation, soils, and near-surface ground temperatures at tall and dwarf shrub tundra sites adjacent to and distant from the Dempster Highway in the Northwest Territories of Canada. We found that alder growth and recruitment were significantly enhanced adjacent to the highway. Where alder shrubs had formed closed canopies, we observed dramatic alterations to plant community composition, soil properties, and ground temperatures. Tall shrub sites adjacent to the road exhibited less understory vegetation, greater litter and organic layer thickness, higher nutrient availability, and thicker snowpack than all other site types. Our results show that in shrub tundra ecosystems the conditions generated by the maintenance and use of a gravel road can drive ecological feedbacks that magnify changes to vegetation communities and soils. We found that where the road facilitated shrub dominance, feedbacks were initiated that enhanced snow accumulation and altered ground temperatures and soil chemistry. In turn, these changes likely promoted enhanced shrub recruitment and growth. Shrub proliferation adjacent to highways is an important consideration for the planning and maintenance of this form of infrastructure.

In the High Arctic, analyses of satellite images suggest a recent increase in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and warming experiments have shown a positive correlation between temperature and shrub cover, but little is known about the responses of natural systems. In this context, we investigated populations of Arctic willow (Salix arctica Pall.) to assess the potential contribution of this structuring species to High Arctic shrubification. LocationSeven polar semidesert sites, including two glacier forelands, in High Arctic Canada and Greenland. MethodsWe evaluated the size distribution and establishment age of Arctic willow populations through field measurements and dendrochronological analysis. We also assessed the cover of Arctic willow at each site and compared current data with historical records. ResultsAge determination of over 200 large individuals established by seed suggests that colonization events were associated with the melting of permanent snow and glacial ice. Size distributions showed that recent recruitment was more frequent on glacier forelands, even though seedling establishment was common in other sites. Comparing our measurements with previous studies at the same sites revealed that significant increases in cover over the past few decades occurred only on glacier forelands. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that the population structure and dynamics of Arctic willow in the High Arctic are influenced by site-specific factors. Rapid glacier retreat is increasing the extent of the glacier forelands, which are currently experiencing relatively rapid plant colonization. Some sheltered sites with greater snow accumulation will probably experience increased shrub colonization under current and predicted climate change. It appears, however, that shrub recruitment and growth are still strongly limited by water availability, and the reduction in permanent snow cover may exacerbate this stress.","10.1111/jbi.12350","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub population dynamics","growth; cover","Nunavut, CA; Zackenberg, GL",79.133,-79.733,"dendrochronology; vegetation surveys","successional time",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Salix arctica","1","species",""

The rate and magnitude of change in soil fertility may be critical to determining plant community responses, and so effects of slow increases in nutrient availability due to climate warming may differ substantially from those of chronic high-level fertilizer additions. We investigated above- and below-ground plant biomass responses to experimental summer warming and above-ground responses to nutrient additions (low-level N and factorial N and P) in a mesic birch hummock tundra community in the central Canadian Low Arctic after eight years of experimental treatment. Plant community biomass responses to experimental warming were fundamentally different from those of high-level N and/or P additions, mainly due to opposing effects on the evergreen shrubs. Evergreen shrub above-ground biomass increased 66% with greenhouse warming, but decreased on average 70% with high-level N and/or P additions, driven by the strong responses of Rhododendron subarcticum. Because of this evergreen response, greenhouse-warming increased total above-ground biomass by 32% and total below-ground biomass by 70%, but did not significantly change the total above-ground/below-ground biomass ratio. However, warming increased the shoot/root ratio of Betula glandulosa threefold. Increased soil fertility created interactions between N and P availability, whereby increased P availability led to a substantial increase in inorganic N availability. Meanwhile, the growth of several species that span a range of different functional groups was stimulated by the separate N and P additions. These factorial fertilization results highlight the importance of understanding climate warming impacts on availability of both of these nutrients in order to predict plant community responses. Synthesis. Our results strongly suggest that the trajectory of mesic tundra vegetation change with warming depends critically on the rate of increase in soil fertility. The relatively large greenhouse-induced biomass increase in evergreen compared to deciduous shrubs suggests that carbon balance and albedo feedbacks to warming will be restricted in mesic tundra ecosystems, at least in their early responses to climate change.","10.1111/1365-2745.12237","09/09/2020","empirical","vegetation change","cover change","Northwest Territories, CA",64.867,-111.55,"factorial experiment","summer temperature; nutrient addition",2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"abiotic","Betula glandulosa; Vaccinium uliginosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Rhododendron subarcticum","4","species",""

Shrub recruits outside established patches represent the forefront of area expansion, but their dynamics may be sensitive to the action of several herbivore species. The empirical evidence for how different-sized herbivores affect recruits of tall shrubs is lacking. Moreover, although management and natural population dynamics of herbivores happens at landscape and regional scales, field research on herbivore impacts on shrubs seldom covers these scales. Reindeer management and different rodent population dynamics result in regional variation in herbivore abundances in arctic Norway. We conducted an herbivore exclusion experiment, covering three low-arctic river catchments with contrasting herbivore abundances. We assessed the impacts of small rodents and reindeer on growth, and survival of willow Salix spp. recruits after 3years of herbivore exclusion. As expected, the Salix recruits increased in sizes and had lower mortality when released from herbivores. Both types of herbivores had strong impacts on size and survival of Salix recruits. Spatially contrasting results were consistent with regional differences in the abundance of reindeer and rodents; herbivore impacts on shrubs were found when at least one type of herbivore was abundant. However, the impact was not independent of herbivore species. While both browsing from reindeer and rodents pruned the recruits and prevented them from escaping the field layer, the rodents also inflicted substantial mortality and thus thinned the stand of recruits.Synthesis and applications. Sympatric populations of rodents and reindeer have strongly complementary impacts on shrub recruits and may limit the expansion potential of tall shrubs even in the most productive habitats of arctic tundra. The spatial correspondence between shrub recruits performance and herbivore abundances, found after a short time period, suggests that the extent of tall shrub expansion in tundra is contingent on current variation and future trends in herbivore populations. In areas where humans control large herbivore populations, management may opt to counteract climate-driven shrub expansion also in habitats that are most prone to such expansion.

Since environmental perturbations commonly occur in concert, there is a need for experimental investigations in which single, combined and interactive effects of environmental factors are studied. We studied interactive effects of N-fertilization (40 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and disturbance, i.e. removing the vegetation and soil organic layers, in the forest-tundra ecotone in northern Finland during 2002-2005. Plant abundances were measured in a coniferous forest, mountain birch forest and tundra heath. Both N-fertilization and disturbance reinforced the proportion of deciduous (Vaccinium myrtillus) and the graminoids (i.e. Deschampsia flexuosa and Carex sp.) at the expense of evergreens in vegetation. N-fertilization also enhanced the post-disturbance recovery of graminoids. Vegetation recovery was slow in the tundra heath, where N-fertilization decreased the abundance of the evergreen Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum. Although the changes in vegetation due to the N-fertilization and disturbance could be detected, they did not change the initial dominance of plant functional types. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing N affects the rate rather than direction of recovery after disturbance. Moreover, plant communities differ in terms of their capabilities to respond to multiple perturbations which should be taken into account when evaluating future vegetation responses under changing environment in at high-latitude and high-altitude ecosystems.","10.1007/s11258-013-0271-1","09/09/2020","empirical","disturbance response","cover change","Ounastunturi, FI",68.233,23.75,"factorial experiment","nitrogen addition; disturbance",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"abiotic","Vaccinium myrtillus; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Empetrum nigrum","3","species",""

It has not been investigated how crowberry phenolics will respond to global climate change. In the tundra, grazing by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) affects vegetation and soil nutrient availability, but almost nothing is known about the interactions between grazing and global climate change on plant phenolics. We performed a factorial warming and fertilization experiment in a tundra ecosystem under light grazing and heavy grazing and analyzed individual foliar phenolics and crowberry abundance. Crowberry was more abundant under light grazing than heavy grazing. Although phenolic concentrations did not differ between grazing intensities, responses of crowberry abundance and phenolic concentrations to warming varied significantly depending on grazing intensity. Under light grazing, warming increased crowberry abundance and the concentration of stilbenes, but decreased e.g., the concentrations of flavonols, condensed tannins, and batatasin-III, resulting in no change in total phenolics. Under heavy grazing, warming did not affect crowberry abundance, and induced a weak but consistent decrease among the different phenolic compound groups, resulting in a net decrease in total phenolics. Our results show that the different phenolic compound groups may show varying or even opposing responses to warming in the tundra at different levels of grazing intensity. Even when plant phenolic concentrations do not directly respond to grazing, grazers may have a key control over plant responses to changes in the abiotic environment, reflecting multiple adaptive purposes of plant phenolics and complex interactions between the biotic and the abiotic factors.","10.1007/s10886-013-0367-z","09/09/2020","empirical","Empetrum metabolism","metabolism","Raisduoddar, NO",69.65,27.5,"factorial experiment","fertilisation; summer temperature; herbivory",3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,"abiotic & biotic","Empetrum nigrum","1","species",""

By annually monitoring community composition in grazed control plots and herbivore-free exclosures at an Arctic location for 15 years, we detected multiple biotic interactions. Regular rodent cycles acted as pulses driving synchronous fluctuations in the biomass of field-layer vegetation; reindeer influenced the biomass of taller shrubs, and the abundance of plant pathogenic fungi increased when densities of their host plants increased in exclosures. Two outbreaks of geometrid moths occurred during the study period, with contrasting effects on the field layer: one in 2004 had marginal effects, while one in 2012 severely reduced biomass in the control plots and eliminated biomass that had accumulated over 15 years in the exclosures. The latter was followed by a dramatic decline of the dominant understory dwarf-shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum, driven by an interaction between moth herbivory on top buds and leaves, and increased disease severity of a pathogenic fungus.

The changes in plant abundance and chemistry might have cascading effects on tundra food webs, but an integrated understanding of how the responses vary between habitats and across environmental gradients is lacking. We assessed responses in plant abundance and plant chemistry to warmer climate, both at species and community levels, in two different habitats. We used a long-term and multisite warming (OTC) experiment in the Scandinavian forest-tundra ecotone to investigate (i) changes in plant community composition and (ii) responses in foliar nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon-based secondary compound concentrations in two dominant evergreen dwarf-shrubs (Empetrum hermaphroditum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and two deciduous shrubs (Vaccinium myrtillus and Betula nana). We found that initial plant community composition, and the functional traits of these plants, will determine the responsiveness of the community composition, and thus community traits, to experimental warming. Although changes in plant chemistry within species were minor, alterations in plant community composition drive changes in community-level nutrient concentrations. In view of projected climate change, our results suggest that plant abundance will increase in the future, but nutrient concentrations in the tundra field layer vegetation will decrease. These effects are large enough to have knock-on consequences for major ecosystem processes like herbivory and nutrient cycling. The reduced food quality could lead to weaker trophic cascades and weaker top down control of plant community biomass and composition in the future.

The reduction in albedo associated with shrub-induced 'greening' of the tundra is predicted to cause significant positive feedbacks to regional warming. Enhanced soil fertility arising from climate change is expected to be the primary mechanism driving shrub responses, yet our overall understanding of the relative importance of soil nitrogen ( N) and phosphorus ( P) availability and the significance of other ecological drivers is constrained by experiments with varying treatments, sites, and durations. We investigated dwarf birch apical stem growth responses to a wide range of ecological factors ( enhanced summer temperatures, deepened snow, caribou exclusion, factorial high level nitrogen and phosphorus additions, and low level nitrogen additions) after six years of experimental manipulations in birch hummock tundra. As expected, birch apical stem growth was more strongly enhanced by the substantial increases in nutrient supply than by our changes in any of the other ecological factors. The factorial additions revealed that P availability was at least as important as that of N, and our low N additions demonstrated that growth was unresponsive to moderate increases in soil nitrogen alone. Experimental warming increased apical stem growth 2.5-fold-considerably more than in past studies-probably due to the relatively strong effect of our greenhouses on soil temperature.

We conducted an UV-B exclusion experiment in a dwarf shrub heath in NE Greenland (74 degrees N), with open control, filter control, UV-B filtering and UV-AB filtering, all in combination with leaf angle control. Two sites with natural leaf positions had ground angles 0 degrees ('level site') and 45 degrees ('sloping site'), while at a third site the leaves were fixed in an angle of 45 degrees to homogenize the irradiance dose ('fixed leaf angle site'). The photosynthetic performance of the leaves was characterized by simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and the PSII performance through the growing season was investigated with fluorescence measurements. Leaf harvest towards the end of the growing season was done to determine the specific leaf area and the content of carbon, nitrogen and UV-B absorbing compounds. Compared to a 60% reduced UV-B irradiance, the ambient solar UV-B reduced net photosynthesis in Salix arctica leaves fixed in the 45 degrees position which exposed leaves to maximum natural irradiance. Also a reduced Calvin Cycle capacity was found, i.e. the maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) and the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (V-cmax), and the PSII performance showed a decreased quantum yield and increased energy dissipation. A parallel response pattern and reduced PSII performance at all three sites indicate that these responses take place in all leaves across position in the vegetation. These findings add to the evidence that the ambient solar UV-B currently is a significant stress factor for plants in high Arctic Greenland. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We present 15 new C. tetragona chronologies from three sites (Axel Heiberg, Bathurst, and Devon islands) in the eastern Canadian Arctic, of which three are the first continuous stable carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13) time series developed for Arctic shrubs. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses revealed that multiple and different climate factors influenced the chronologies within and between the three sites. At the Axel Heiberg Island site, the dominant climatic influences over annual stem elongation were previous year (t-1) and current year (t) summer precipitation, while annual production of flower buds was influenced by (t) winter precipitation and spring temperature. At Bathurst Island, annual production of flower buds responded to (t-l) growing season sunshine hours and winter precipitation and to (t) late growing season temperature and moisture availability. Our analysis of the Axel Heiberg and Bathurst Island models revealed the positive influence on delta C-13 values of (t-1) winter temperature and on Bathurst Island only, of (t-1) spring sunshine hours. The combined influence of these parameters on spring moisture availability suggests that the delta C-13 ratios varied in response to stomatal conductance. At Devon Island, the delta C-13 values varied in response to (t) and (t-1) spring and summer temperature and spring and fall solar radiation, which in turn influence the rate of photosynthesis. Our study supports the emerging hypothesis that Arctic shrubs are sensitive to climate. However, strong spatial variation in plant-climate response characterized our sampling sites. This variation may be linked to site sensitivity, or regional climate variability due to geographic and topographic differences, or both.","10.14430/arctic4083","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth","growth","Nunavut, CA",80.167,-87.5,"dendrochronology; isotope analysis","summer temperature; summer precipitation",2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Cassiope tetragona","1","species",""

A transition towards more shrub-dominated tundra may have large implications for the regional surface energy balance, permafrost stability and carbon storage capacity, with consequences for the global climate system. However, little information is available on the natural long-term shrub growth response to climatic variability. Our aim was to determine the climate factor and time period that are most important to annual shrub growth in our research site in NE-Siberia. Therefore, we determined annual radial growth rates in Salix pulchra and Betula nana shrubs by measuring ring widths. We constructed shrub ring width chronologies and compared growth rates to regional climate and remotely sensed greenness data. Early summer temperature was the most important factor influencing ring width of S. pulchra (Pearson's r = 0.73, p < 0.001) and B. nana (Pearson's r = 0.46, p < 0.001). No effect of winter precipitation on shrub growth was observed. In contrast, summer precipitation of the previous year correlated positively with B. nana ring width (Pearson's r = 0.42, p < 0.01), suggesting that wet summers facilitate shrub growth in the following growing season. S. pulchra ring width correlated positively with peak summer NDVI, despite the small coverage of S. pulchra shrubs (<5% surface cover) in our research area. We provide the first climate-growth study on shrubs for Northeast Siberia, the largest tundra region in the world. We show that two deciduous shrub species with markedly different growth forms have a similar growth response to changes in climate. The obtained shrub growth response to climate variability in the past increases our understanding of the mechanisms underlying current shrub expansion, which is required to predict future climate-driven tundra vegetation shifts.","10.5194/bg-8-1169-2011","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth","growth","Siberian Arctic, RU",70.817,147.467,"dendrochronology; remote sensing","winter temperature; spring temperature; summer temperature; winter precipitation; spring precipitation; summer precipitation; productivity",7,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic & biotic","Salix pulchra; Betula nana","2","species",""

Therefore, there is a need for reliable climate proxies to increase knowledge of past and future Arctic climate change. Annual shoot length increase of the circumarctic dwarf shrub species Cassiope tetragona represents such a new climate proxy. We measured annual shoot length increase of 32 plant samples of the circumarctic dwarf shrub species C tetragona using the presence of wintermarksepta within the stems, resulting in a 169 year growth chronology (1840-2008) for a High Arctic site on Svalbard. This is the longest growth chronology for dwarf shrub species produced up to now. Relationships between climate and Cassiope growth were investigated through correlative, response function and forward stepwise multiple regression analysis. July average air temperature was found to be the most important factor determining growth, by itself capable of explaining 41% of the variance in shoot growth between 1912 and 2008. The second best predictors were previous year September precipitation sums and average air temperatures, along with several previous growth parameters. A multiple regression model explaining growth with current July and previous year September temperature, combined with previous growth of lag 1, 2 and 5 years as predictors explains 70% of the observed variance in growth. July temperatures and previous year September precipitation sums alone explain 59% of the variance in standardized growth. Mean July air temperature was reconstructed for the period between 1876 and 2007 by a growth-temperature transfer model, using current and following year's growth. The estimated temperatures correlated well with measured temperatures over the calibration (1912-1959) and verification (1960-2007) period: R-2 = 0.34 and R-2 = 0.47, respectively. The instrumental record (1912-2008) extended with these reliable mean July temperature estimates (1876-1911) reveals a significant warming trend on Svalbard since 1876 of 0.07 degrees C decade(-1) on average. This study shows that the climate-growth relationships in C tetragona, its longevity, its annual resolution, the availability of (sub)fossil fragments in tundra soil cores and its circumartic distribution make it a very valuable tool for climate reconstructions beyond the instrumental record and in areas lacking meteorological data, throughout the Arctic.

However, both the protection mechanisms may be lost with winter climate change, especially during extreme winter warming events where loss of snow cover from snow melt results in exposure of plants to warm temperatures and then returning extreme cold in the absence of insulating snow. These events cause considerable damage to Arctic plants, but physiological responses behind such damage remain unknown. Here, we report simulations of extreme winter warming events using infrared heating lamps and soil warming cables in a sub-Arctic heathland. During these events, we measured maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII), photosynthesis, respiration, bud swelling and associated bud carbohydrate changes and lipid peroxidation to identify physiological responses during and after the winter warming events in three dwarf shrub species: Empetrum hermaphroditum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Vaccinium myrtillus. Winter warming increased maximum quantum yield of PSII, and photosynthesis was initiated for E. hermaphroditum and V. vitis-idaea. Bud swelling, bud carbohydrate decreases and lipid peroxidation were largest for E. hermaphroditum, whereas V. myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea showed no or less strong responses. Increased physiological activity and bud swelling suggest that sub-Arctic plants can initiate spring-like development in response to a short winter warming event. Lipid peroxidation suggests that plants experience increased winter stress. The observed differences between species in physiological responses are broadly consistent with interspecific differences in damage seen in previous studies, with E. hermaphroditum and V. myrtillus tending to be most sensitive. This suggests that initiation of spring-like development may be a major driver in the damage caused by winter warming events that are predicted to become more frequent in some regions of the Arctic and that may ultimately drive plant community shifts.","10.1111/j.1399-3054.2010.01386.x","09/09/2020","empirical","plant physiology","physiology","Abisko, SE",68.35,18.817,"physiology","winter extreme events",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Empetrum nigrum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Vaccinium myrtillus","3","species",""

In a field experiment in subarctic tundra in Interior Alaska, I manipulated the timing of snowmelt and measured the response in mortality, phenology, growth, and reproduction of the eight dominant plant species. I then tested whether the phenological development of these species was controlled by snowmelt date or by temperature (in particular growing degree days, GDD). In order to expand our understanding of plant sensitivity to snowmelt timing, I explored whether the response patterns can be generalized with regard to the temporal niche of each species. Differences in the phenology between treatments were only found for the first stages of the phenological development (=phenophases). The earlier the temporal niche (i.e., the sooner after snowmelt a species develops) the more its phenology was sensitive to snowmelt. Later phenophases were mostly controlled by GDD, especially in late-developing species. In no species did an earlier snowmelt and a longer growing season directly enhance plant fitness or fecundity, in spite of the changes in the timing of plant development. In conclusion, the temporal niche of a species' phenological development could be a predictor of its response to snowmelt timing. However, only the first phenophases were susceptible to changes in snowmelt, and no short-term effects on plant fitness were found.","10.1007/s11258-009-9653-9","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub performance","growth; phenology; reproduction","Alaska, US",64.95,-148.367,"experimental manipulation","snow cover",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Rhododendron tomentosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Empetrum nigrum; Cassiope tetragona; Betula nana; Vaccinium uliginosum","6","species",""

Methods: Trait responses of naturally regenerated birch saplings to warming (open-top chambers), and changed grazing regime (exclosures) were compared with those growing in unmanipulated conditions over a 10-year period (1999-2008). The effect of treatment over time and differences between treatments were analysed with repeated measures GLM (Generalised Linear Model) and simple contrasts in GLM. Results: Warming alone had no major effect on trait responses, however, significantly smaller leaves and an increased number of short shoots indicated warming-related growth constraints. Grazing showed a strong controlling effect on most traits, conserving low stature sapling stage characterised by fewer shoots and larger leaves, compared with non-grazed treatments. Conclusions: Although derived from one experimental site, the results point to a grazing-controlled response to environmental change, with climate (warming) as a secondary driver.

At the top of the slope and in areas with shallow thaw, the height and growth of willow were low compared to other slope positions and to areas with deep thaw. An increasing level of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) grazing intensity was associated with decreased height and growth of willow and also associated with reduced foraging activity of willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus). The results show that even though increasing summer warmth is likely to enhance willow growth, there are other factors such as distance from the sea that also affect the growth and height of willow.

We addressed these alternative explanations by following the changes in plant community composition during the last 10 years in permanent plots inside and outside exclosures with different mesh sizes that exclude either only reindeer or all mammalian herbivores including voles and lemmings. The exclosures were replicated at three forest and tundra sites at four different locations along a climatic gradient ( oceanic to continental) in northern Fennoscandia. Since the last 10 years have been exceptionally warm, we could study how warming has influenced the vegetation in different grazing treatments. Our results show that the abundance of the dominant shrub, Betula nana, has increased during the last decade, but that the increase was more pronounced when herbivores were excluded. Reindeer have the largest effect on shrubs in tundra, while voles and lemmings have a larger effect in the forest. The positive relationship between annual mean temperature and shrub growth in the absence of herbivores and the lack of relationships in grazed controls is another indication that shrub abundance is controlled by an interaction between herbivores and climate. In addition to their effects on taller shrubs (>0.3 m), reindeer reduced the abundance of lichens, whereas microtine rodents reduced the abundance of dwarf shrubs (<0.3 m) and mosses. In contrast to short-term responses, competitive interactions between dwarf shrubs and lichens were evident in the long term.

Association of phenological patterns with growth form will therefore help elucidate the role of phenology in an ecosystem. We ask whether growth forms of common vascular plants differ in terms of vegetative and flowering phenology, and if such phenological differences are consistent across environmental gradients caused by landscape-scale topography. Location: A high-latitude alpine landscape in Finnmark County, Norway (70 degrees N). Methods: We assessed vegetative and flowering phenology repeatedly in five growth forms represented by 11 common vascular plant species across an altitudinal gradient and among differing slope aspects. Results: Species phenology Clustered well according to growth form, and growth form strongly explained variation in both flowering and vegetative phenology. Altitude and aspect were poor predictors of phenological variation. Vegetative phenology of the growth forms, ranked from slowest to fastest, was in the order evergreen shrubs <sedges-deciduous shrubs <grasses <forbs, while a reverse ranking was found for flowering phenology. Conclusion: Growth form-specific phenological patterns are associated with fundamentally different abilities for resource acquisition and resource conservation. The weak effect of landscape-scale topographic factors indicates that variation within growth forms is mainly influenced by local environmental factors not accounted for in this study.

Along with air and soil warming, one of the consequences of warming likely to be important for carbon assimilation of tundra plant species is an expected 40% increase in growing season length. We examined the effects of a lengthened growing season and soil warming on the photosynthetic capacity of seven tundra plant species from four growth forms that comprise >90% of the vascular cover of wet tussock tundra. Maximum photosynthetic capacity of these key species was relatively unchanged by the manipulation that significantly altered growing season length, active layer depth, and soil temperatures. Highest photosynthetic rates were found for the forb, Polygonum bistorta, and the lowest for dwarf evergreen shrubs. Seasonal patterns revealed that plants maintained relatively high light-saturated photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) values throughout most of the growing season. Interannual variation was significant, but differences were small for most species. The study shows that tundra species operate within a relatively narrow range for maximum photosynthetic capacity with this maximum seldom being reached under ambient conditions. Thus, when evaluating the effects of climate change on tundra ecosystem carbon uptake, species composition and total photosynthetic leaf area should be considered first. These two factors will affect the system carbon exchange capacity during climate warming more so than species-level assimilation capacity.","10.1657/1523-0430(06-015)[STARR]2.0.CO;2","09/09/2020","empirical","photosynthetic activity","photosynthetic activity","Alaska, US",68.633,-149.567,"factorial experiment","soil summer temperature; growing season length",2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Rhododendron tomentosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Betula nana; Salix pulchra","4","species",""

In addition, warming can cause permafrost to thaw and thermokarst (ground subsidence) to develop, which can alter the structure of the ecosystem by altering hydrological patterns within a site. These multiple direct and indirect effects of permafrost thawing are difficult to simulate in experimental approaches that often manipulate only one or two factors. Here, we used a natural gradient approach with three sites to represent stages in the process of permafrost thawing and thermokarst. We found that vascular plant biomass shifted from graminoid-dominated tundra in the least disturbed site to shrub-dominated tundra at the oldest, most subsided site, whereas the intermediate site was co-dominated by both plant functional groups. Vascular plant productivity patterns followed the changes in biomass, whereas nonvascular moss productivity was especially important in the oldest, most subsided site. The coefficient of variation for soil moisture was higher in the oldest, most subsided site suggesting that in addition to more wet microsites, there were other microsites that were drier. Across all sites, graminoids preferred the cold, dry microsites whereas the moss and shrubs were associated with the warm, moist microsites.

The balance between positive and negative species interactions is known to shift along spatial, temporal and environmental gradients and thus is likely to be affected by climate change. Winter temperature and precipitation patterns in Interior Alaska are rapidly changing and could lead to warmer winters with a shallow, early melting snow cover in the near future. We conducted snow manipulation and neighbour removal experiments to test whether the relative importance of positive and negative species interactions differs between three winter climate scenarios in a subarctic tundra community. In plots with ambient, manually advanced or delayed snowmelt, we assessed the relative importance of neighbours for survival, phenology, growth and reproduction of two dwarf shrub species. Under ambient conditions and after delayed snowmelt, positive and negative neighbour effects were generally balanced, but when snowmelt was advanced we found overall facilitative neighbour effects on survival, phenology, growth and reproduction of Empetrum nigrum, the earlier developing of the two target species. As earlier snowmelt was correlated with colder spring temperatures and a higher number of frosts, we conclude that plants experienced harsher environmental conditions after early snowmelt and that neighbours could have played an important role in ameliorating the physical environment at the beginning of the growing season.","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01185.x","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub interactions","phenology; survival; growth; reproduction","Alaska, US",64.95,-148.367,"factorial experiment","snow cover; neighbour presence",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,"abiotic & biotic","Empetrum nigrum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea","2","species",""

After 10 years of experimental increase of temperature, nutrient levels and light attenuation in a sub-arctic, alpine ecosystem, we investigated the effects on carbon based secondary compounds (CBSC) and nitrogen in one dominant deciduous dwarf shrub, Salix herbacea x polaris and two dominant evergreen dwarf shrubs, Cassiope tetragona and Vaccinium vitis-idaea throughout one growing season. The main aims were to compare the seasonal course and treatment effects on CBSC among the species, life forms and leaf cohorts and to examine whether the responses in different CBSC were consistent across compounds. The changes in leaf chemistry both during the season and in response to the treatments were higher in S. herbacea x polaris than in the corresponding current year's leaf cohort of the evergreen C. tetragona. The changes were also much higher than in the 1-year-old leaves of the two evergreens probably due to differences in dilution and turnover of CBSC in growing and mature leaves paired with different rates of allocation. Most low molecular weight phenolics in the current year's leaves decreased in all treatments. Condensed tannins and the tannin-to-N ratio, however, either increased or decreased, and the strength and even direction of the responses varied among the species and leaf cohorts, supporting views of influential factors additional to resource-based or developmental controls, as e.g. species specific or genetic controls of CBSC. The results indicate that there is no common response to environmental changes across species and substances. However, the pronounced treatment responses imply that the quality of the herbivore forage is likely to be strongly affected in a changing arctic environment, although both the direction and strength of the responses will be different among plant species, tissue types and substances.","10.1007/s00442-005-0233-y","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub chemical composition","chemical profile","Abisko, SE",68.35,18.817,"factorial experiment","summer temperature; fertilisation; shading",3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"abiotic","Salix herbacea x polaris; Cassiope tetragona; Vaccinium vitis-idaea","3","species",""

However, few studies have actually addressed this question experimentally in the Arctic, and those that did found only little evidence for competition. Such species interactions will presumably become more important in the future, as Global Climate Change takes effect on terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated plant-plant interactions in the High Arctic, following the growth of Luzula confusa and Salix polaris in pure and mixed stands, and under elevated-temperature treatment over 2 years. To understand the mechanisms of competition, a parallel experiment was undertaken in phytotrons, manipulating competition, temperature and nutrient availability. Our findings indicate that competition is acting in the natural vegetation, and that climatic warming will alter the balance of interactions in favour of the dwarf shrub S. polaris. The phytotron experiment suggested that the mechanism is a higher responsiveness of Salix to nutrient availability, which increased under warming in the field. While Luzula showed a positive response to higher temperature in the lab, its performance in mixed stands in the field was actually reduced by warming, indicating a competitive repression of growth by Salix. The growth of Salix was also reduced by the presence of Luzula, but it was still able to profit from warming. Our findings suggest that climatic warming will result in greater shrub dominance of High Arctic tundra, but we also conjecture that grazing could reverse the situation to a graminoid-dominated tundra. These two divergent scenarios would have different implications for ecosystem feedbacks to climatic change.","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00830.x","09/09/2020","empirical","vegetation interactions","growth","Svalbard, NO",77.9,15.2,"transplant experiment","summer temperature; competition",2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"abiotic & biotic","Salix polaris","1","species",""

The effects of these treatments on vegetation cover were assessed at the start of the 1991, 1993, and 1995 field seasons, and at peak biomass in the same years. Over the first season of the experiment (1991), changes in percentage total living vegetation cover were significantly greater, and changes in dead vegetation cover significantly lower, in the tented treatments. In subsequent seasons, changes in total living cover were also greater under treatments simulating climate change, although the significant factors and interactions were year-specific. Between years, at both the early and mid-season sampling periods, the fertilizer application had the strongest effect on changes in plant cover, significantly decreasing cover of living Dryas octopetala, Saxifraga oppositifolia, and bare ground between 1991 and 1995, while increasing cover of bryophytes, Salix polaris, Polygonum viviparum, and total dead vegetation. Although cover of D. octopetala was greater during the first three years of fertilizer addition, marked winter injury occurred in this species on fertilized plots during winter 1993-1994. This resulted in reductions in total live cover and D. octopetala cover and an increase in total dead cover (by up to 22%) in watered and fertilized plots between 1991 and 1995. Seedlings of nitrophilous immigrant species were established naturally on bare ground in fertilized plots in the third year of the study and subsequently increased in number, so that after five seasons the community tended more toward bird-cliff vegetation rather than polar semi-desert vegetation.

The responses of the vegetation to the perturbations were then assessed by point intercept (quadrat) analysis followed by determination of above-ground biomass. 2 Nineteen vascular and 23 non-vascular species (or species groups) were recorded and the most dramatic response was that of the grass Calamagrostis lapponica to nutrient addition, with abundance being stimulated by a factor of more than 18 compared with plots not subjected to nutrient addition. Calamagrostis lapponica did not show any significant responses to temperature or water alone but there was a synergistic interaction between all three variables. 3 The abundance of the dominant dwarf shrubs (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, V. myrtillus and V. uliginosum) was unaffected by the perturbations but elevated temperature stimulated the biomass of V. uliginosum by 125% and total shrub biomass by 16%. The low ratio of current year's growth to standing biomass may have concealed other responses of the dwarf shrub group to the perturbations. 4 The response of the non-vascular flora to the perturbations was either neutral or negative, with lichens showing the most dramatic responses. Lichen biomass on temperature- and nutrient-amended plots was 56% and 18%, respectively, of that on unperturbed plots. Nutrients also exerted a negative effect on the biomass of bryophytes, and the combined biomass of lichens and bryophytes on nutrient-treated plots was almost a third of that on plots which did not receive additional nutrients. 5 Total above-ground biomass was not affected by the perturbations but the total number of interceptions determined by point quadrat analysis was greater on the elevated temperature and nutrient-treated plots. Point quadrat analysis also revealed an accumulation of litter and standing dead material in response to the nutrient and temperature perturbations, both singly and in combination, suggesting a faster turnover of plant material. 6 Both temperature and nutrients increased canopy height and also interacted synergistically such that together they resulted in a mean canopy height of 14.9 cm compared with 8.0 cm in plots subjected to neither perturbation. 7 Nutrient addition lowered species richness by 17.7%, mainly through its impact on the mosses and lichens. 8 In general, nutrient addition elicited the greatest response, followed by temperature, with water exerting little measurable influence. There were a number of important interactions that were often synergistic, and some involved water. 9 Species' responses were highly individualistic and changes in the community were mediated through the response of a small number of key species already present in the community, with no invasion of new species.

Warming enhanced the green biomass (equivalent to the last 3-4 years of leaf production) and the ratio of green to brown biomass of C. tetragona at the fellfield, and diluted the shoot N concentration. Fertilizer application led to higher shoot N concentration and larger green-to-brown biomass ratio at both sites, and fertilizer application and warming generally had an additive effect on the green biomass. We conclude that both warming and increased soil nutrient availability stimulated the growth of C. tetragona at the fellfield whereas at the heath there was a clear increase in production only if enhanced temperature was combined with nutrient application. Across treatments C. tetragona at the fellfield had 0.6 parts per thousand higher delta(13)C and 1.4 mg g(-1) more leaf N, and the soil organic matter delta(13)C was 1.0 parts per thousand higher at the fellfield than at the heath. However, an increase in shoot N concentration with altitude does not necessarily lead to higher delta(13)C as no differences in delta(13)C were observed when leaf N of the two dwarf shrubs was increased by fertilizer application C. tetragona in non-warmed plots had higher delta(13)C values than those from warmed plots at the same altitude, which provides the first in situ experimental validation of the theory that temperature partly is responsible for altitudinal trends in plant carbon isotope discrimination. Increased biomass and chlorophyll concentration of C. tetragona in warmed plots points to increased assimilation, at least at the fellfield. As the delta(13)C-based and, therefore, time-integrated estimate of the ratio of CO, concentration in the leaf intercellular spaces to that in the atmosphere (C-i/C-a) also increased, warming probably enhanced the stomatal conductance relatively more than the C assimilation, which may be harmful if climatic change leads to reduced soil moisture content and increased plant competition for water. At both sites C. tetragona and E. hermaphroditum responded to shade by increasing the concentration of shoot N and photosynthetic pigments whereas biomass production (and therefore also net photosynthesis) did not decline. Shade was accompanied by a 0.6-1.3 parts per thousand (E. hermaphroditum) or 1.2-2.2 parts per thousand (C. tetragona) decrease in delta(13)C. This could be due to enhanced stomatal conductance with shading, and perhaps to shade reducing the ericoid mycorrhizal uptake of soil organic C, a factor which has been overlooked as an influence on plant delta(13)C.","10.1007/BF00328785","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub performance","biomass; chemical composition; physiology","Abisko, SE",68.35,18.817,"factorial experiment","annual temperature; fertilisation; shading",3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"abiotic","Cassiope tetragona; Empetrum nigrum","2","species",""

Neither cumulative summer temperature nor summer precipitation accounted for the variations in annual growth of any dwarf shrub species; however, ramet age contributed significantly to the observed variation in growth of shoots of V. vitis-idaea and V. uliginosum. 3 The growth of ramets of E. nigrum in unmanipulated plots was positively correlated with the cover of V. myrtillus and total cover of dwarf shrubs; the growth of V. uliginosum was similarly correlated with the cover of V, myrtillus in undisturbed plots. Furthermore, the growth of both E. nigrum and V. uliginosum was reduced by the removal of V. uliginosum and V. myrtillus, respectively.

The populations were selected to represent different parts of the range of the species, one growing in a high arctic coastal heath at Ny-Alesund (Svalbard, northern part of the species' range), one at a subarctic fellfield at 1150 m a.s.l. at Abisko, Swedish Lapland, and one in a subarctic tree-line heath at 450 m a.s.l. at Abisko, southern part of the species' range. The manipulations included nutrient addition, shading and two levels of temperature enhancement using passive greenhouses. The micrometeorological effects of the shading treatment was similar to that of a mountain birch canopy and the temperature enhancement treatments had the desired effect to increase the average air temperature by 2-4-degrees-C. Greenhouses which had a gap between the soil and the greenhouse plastic were particularly successful in creating the desired climatic perturbation without causing extreme maximum temperatures or other unwanted side-effects. The environmental manipulations caused strikingly different responses in the vegetative growth pattern of main shoots of C. tetragona among the three populations: at the subarctic tree-line heath, nutrient addition caused a substantial increase in growth, whereas it was the temperature enhancement treatments that caused increases, although smaller, at the subarctic fellfield and the high arctic heath sites. At the high arctic site, we also found growth reduced in response to shading, but at the subarctic sites, and particularly at the tree-line heath site, shading caused a marked etiolation of the shoots. Hence, different factors seem to produce very different responses in the vegetative growth of C. tetragona in different parts of its geographical range. We conclude that competition for nutrients and light are the main limiting factors for the growth of Cassiope tetragona near the lower distributional limit (LODIL) of the species, but that temperature is the main limiting factor in the northern parts of its range, and at high altitudes in the southern parts of its range. We also suggest that the direct effect of predicted future climatic warming on the growth of Cassiope tetragona will increase towards the north, whereas a possible indirect effect of increasing nutrient availability following a temperature increase will be the main effect in the southern and lower parts of its range. These responses could, however, be modified by shading from other species responding to environmental change by increased growth.","10.2307/3544933","09/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth","growth","Abisko, SE; Svalbard, NO",78.933,11.833,"factorial experiment","summer temperature; fertilisation; shading; CO2 concentration",4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"abiotic","Cassiope tetragona","1","species",""

Biotic interactions are important in determining ecosystem response to such changes, but few studies have been long-term in nature, especially in the High Arctic. Mesic tundra plots on Svalbard, Norway, were subjected to grazing at two different intensities by captive Barnacle geese from 2003-2005, in a factorial design with warming by Open Top Chambers. Warming manipulations were continued through 2014, when we measured vegetation structure and composition as well as growth and reproduction of three dominant species in the mesic meadow. Significantly more dead vascular plant material was found in warmed compared to ambient plots, regardless of grazing history, but in contrast to many short-term experiments no difference in the amount of living material was found. This has strong implications for nutrient and carbon cycling and could feed back into community productivity. Dominant species showed increased flowering in warmed plots, especially in those plots where grazing had been applied. However, this added sexual reproduction did not translate to substantial shifts in vegetative cover. Forbs and rushes increased slightly in warmed plots regardless of grazing, while the dominant shrub, Salix polaris, generally declined with effects dependent on grazing, and the evergreen shrub Dryas octopetala declined with previous intensive grazing. There were no treatment effects on community diversity or evenness. Thus despite no changes in total live abundance, a typical short-term response to environmental conditions, we found pronounced changes in dead biomass indicating that tundra ecosystem processes respond to medium-to long-term changes in conditions caused by 12 seasons of summer warming. We suggest that while high arctic tundra plant communities are fairly resistant to current levels of climate warming, underlying ecosystem processes are beginning to change. In addition, even short bouts of intense herbivory can have long-term consequences for some species in these communities.","10.1088/1748-9326/aa579d","24/09/2020","empirical","community structure","cover; phenology; reproduction","Svalbard, NO",78.19,15.93,"factorial experiment","summer temperature; herbivory",2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"abiotic & biotic","Salix polaris; Dryas octopetala","2","species",""

Measurements were carried out on C. tetragona individuals sampled from three tundra sites, each representing a distinct moisture regime (dry heath, meadow, moist meadow). Individuals were sampled along gradients of experimentally manipulated winter snow depths in a six-year old snow fence experiment: in ambient (c. 20 cm), medium (c. 100 cm), and deep snow (c. 150 cm) plots. The deep-snow treatment consistently and significantly increased C. tetragona growth during the 2008-2011 manipulation period compared to growth in ambient-snow plots. Stem delta N-15 and stem N concentration values were significantly higher in deep-snow individuals compared to individuals growing in ambient-snow plots during the course of the experiment, suggesting that soil N-availability was increased in deep-snow plots as a result of increased soil winter N mineralization. Although interannual growing season-precipitation delta H-2 and stem delta H-2 records closely matched, snow depth did not change stem delta H-2 or delta O-18, suggesting that water source usage by C. tetragona was unaltered. Instead, the deep insulating snowpack may have protected C. tetragona shrubs against frost damage, potentially compensating the detrimental effects of a shortened growing season and associated phenological delay on growth. Our findings suggest that an increase in winter precipitation in the High Arctic, as predicted by climate models, has the potential to alter the growth and ecophysiology of evergreen shrub C. tetragona through changes in plant mineral nutrition and frost damage protection.","10.1088/1748-9326/10/4/044008","24/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth and isotopic composition","growth; isotopic composition","Svalbard, NO",78.17,16.27,"factorial experiment","snow depth",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Cassiope tetragona","1","species",""

We tested the vegetative and reproductive responses of Cassiope tetragona, an arctic shrub, to increased snow depth and delayed snowmelt using a snow fence experiment in Adventdalen, Norway (78 degrees 54'N, 18 degrees 01'E). We recorded seasonal shoot length, number of leaves, and capsules per shoot for three summers (2005-2007): two prior and one after the treatment began. Phenological events were recorded in 2007. The number of seeds per capsule was counted and seed germination was tested. Phenological development was significantly delayed behind fences, with lower shoot length, number of leaves, capsules, and seeds per shoot segment (16, 20, 54 and 11%, respectively) compared to controls, but there was no difference in these parameters between plots prior to fence establishment.

These changes have been predicted to cause afforestation or shrubification of open tundra, increases of warmth-demanding southern species and plant groups favoured by increased moisture, and decline of species and habitats that are dependent on snow cover. In this study, we explore temporal changes in northern tundra upland plant communities along regional gradients and in local habitats. We ask how vegetation changes are linked with long-term trends in regional climate and grazing pressure. LocationNorthern Europe. MethodsIn 2013-2014, we resurveyed a total of 108 vegetation plots on wind-exposed and snow-protected tundra habitats in three subareas along a bioclimatic gradient from the northern boreal to the arctic zone. Vegetation plots were originally sampled in 1964-1967. We related observed vegetation changes to changes in temperature, precipitation and grazing pressure, which all showed regionally variable increases over the study period. ResultsWe found a significant increase of the evergreen dwarf shrub Empetrum nigrum subsp. hermaphroditum in snow-protected communities and a prominent decrease of lichens throughout the study area. No evidence for extensive tree or larger shrub (Betula spp., Salix spp. or Juniperus communis) encroachment despite climatic warming trends was found. Among studied communities, most pronounced changes in vegetation were observed in snow-protected boreal heaths on small isolated uplands, where community composition showed low resemblance to the original composition described decades ago. Changes in plant communities correlated with changes in summer and winter temperatures, summer precipitation and reindeer grazing pressure, yet correlations varied depending on region and habitat. ConclusionsNorthern tundra uplands vary in their resistance to on-going climate change and reindeer grazing. Isolated treeless heaths of boreal forest-tundra ecotone appear least resistant to climate change and have already shifted towards new community states.","10.1111/jvs.12630","24/09/2020","empirical","vegetation changes","abundance","Northern Fennoscandia",70,27,"vegetation surveys","herbivory; annual temperature; annual precipitation",3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"abiotic & biotic","Empetrum nigrum","1","species",""

Using 128 specimens of Salix arctica, S. glauca and Betula nana sampled across Greenland to Svalbard, an overall negative effect of the retreating June sea-ice extent was found on the annual growth.

Reindeer grazing can inhibit shrubification, but grazing impacts on mire vegetation have been overlooked. We studied grazing effects on plant communities and Salix lapponum in oroarctic mires at the border of Finland and Norway. We compared plant community structure and S. lapponum abundance and traits between (1) grazed fens (Finland); (2) experimental exclosures (Finland), where reindeer have been kept out for 13 years; and (3) nongrazed fens (Norway). Grazing effect on shrubification was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI). We did not find a uniform direction of vegetation change connected to the exclosure treatment, and grazing treatments were overlapping in multivariate ordination. Neither NDVI nor LAI indicated clear differences. Instead, significant results were revealed in total abundance of species groups and in S. lapponum traits. The cover of bryophytes was significantly lower under free grazing. Reindeer grazing reduced the abundance, height, and flowering and increased leaf N concentration of S. lapponum. We conclude that reindeer grazing controls willows and affects total abundance of important species groups, and plant community structure is resistant to grazing effects in oroarctic mires.","10.1080/15230430.2019.1679940","24/09/2020","empirical","community structure","abundance","Northern Fennoscandia",68.817,23.817,"vegetation surveys; hebivore exclusion","herbivory",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"biotic","Salix lapponum","1","species",""

We analyzed annual ring growth for an abundant and nearly circumpolar erect willow (Salix lanata L.) from the coastal zone of the northwest Russian Arctic (Nenets Autonomous Okrug). The resulting chronology is strongly related to summer temperature for the period 1942-2005. Remarkably high correlations occur at long distances (> 1600 km) across the tundra and taiga zones of West Siberia and Eastern Europe. We also found a clear relationship with photosynthetic activity for upland vegetation at a regional scale for the period 1981-2005, confirming a parallel 'greening' trend reported for similarly warming North American portions of the tundra biome. The standardized growth curve suggests a significant increase in shrub willow growth over the last six decades. These findings are in line with field and remote sensing studies that have assigned a strong shrub component to the reported greening signal since the early 1980s. Furthermore, the growth trend agrees with qualitative observations by nomadic Nenets reindeer herders of recent increases in willow size in the region. The quality of the chronology as a climate proxy is exceptional. Given its wide geographic distribution and the ready preservation of wood in permafrost, S. lanata L. has great potential for extended temperature reconstructions in remote areas across the Arctic.","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02047.x","24/09/2020","empirical","shrub growth and vegetation productivity","growth; productivity","Nenets Autonomous Okrug, RU",68.667,58.5,"dendrochronology; remote sensing","monthly temperature; monthly precipitation",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"abiotic","Salix lanata","1","species",""

Compound disturbances by insect herbivores can cause sharp transitions between vegetation states with implications for ecosystem productivity and climate feedbacks. By analysing vegetation plots prior to and immediately after a severe and widespread outbreak by geometrid moths in the birch forest-tundra ecotone, we document a shift in forest understorey community composition in response to the moth outbreak. Prior to the moth outbreak, the plots divided into two oligotrophic and one eutrophic plant community. The moth outbreak caused a vegetation state shift in the two oligotrophic communities, but only minor changes in the eutrophic community. In the spatially most widespread communities, oligotrophic dwarf shrub birch forest, dominance by the allelopathic dwarf shrub Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, was effectively broken and replaced by a community dominated by the graminoid Avenella flexuosa, in a manner qualitatively similar to the effect of wild fires in E. nigrum communities in coniferous boreal forest further south. As dominance by E. nigrum is associated with retrogressive succession the observed vegetation state shift has widespread implications for ecosystem productivity on a regional scale. Our findings reveal that the impact of moth outbreaks on the northern boreal birch forest system is highly initial-state dependent, and that the widespread oligotrophic communities have a low resistance to such disturbances. This provides a case for the notion that climate impacts on arctic and northern boreal vegetation may take place most abruptly when conveyed by changed dynamics of irruptive herbivores.","10.1007/s00442-013-2648-1","24/09/2020","empirical","community structure","abundance","Varanger, NO",70.583,29.65,"vegetation surveys","herbivory",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"biotic","Empetrum nigrum; Vaccinium myrtillus","2","species",""

For instance, relatively fast-growing, deciduous shrub species that are the most responsive to warming may also be the most targeted by herbivores such as reindeer, giving less palatable evergreen shrubs the chance to expand. Using herbivore exclosures, we have studied how two grasslands with contrasting nutrient and moisture regimes, a dry, nutrient-poor alpine grass heath and a wet, productive low herb meadow, changed between 1995 and 2012, in grazed and ungrazed conditions. At the grass heath, evergreen low shrub abundance had more than doubled, regardless of grazer treatment, whereas at the low herb meadow, evergreen shrubs had increased only outside exclosures while deciduous tall shrubs and forbs were significantly more abundant inside exclosures. Deciduous tall shrubs were also significantly taller in exclosures. These contrasting findings suggest that the impact of herbivores is to a great deal determined by their influence on competitive interactions between plant species, and therefore depends on the underlying composition of the plant community. Consequently, as the balance in these competitive interactions is shifting due to climate warming, we conclude that the potential of herbivory to influence this balance is considerable yet highly site dependent.","10.1088/1748-9326/aa62af","24/09/2020","empirical","community structure","abundance","Northern Fennoscandia",67.767,17.533,"vegetation surveys; herbivore exclusion","herbivory",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"biotic","Empetrum nigrum; Phyllodoce caerulea; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Vaccinium myrtillus; Betula nana; Salix sp.","5","species",""
519,"own record","J","Young, AB; Watts, DA; Taylor, AH; Post, E",2016,"DENDROCHRONOLOGIA","Species and site differences influence climate-shrub growth responses in West Greenland","We examined the suitability of two deciduous arctic shrubs (Salix glauca L and Betula nana L., hereafter Salix and Betula, respectively) for dendroclimatological analysis at two sites in West Greenland. Chronologies were successfully cross-dated, and the oldest covered the period 1954-2010 (Expressed Population Signal [EPS] > 0.85,1977-2010). Distinctive pointer years, also called micro-rings, including those from a known outbreak of the irruptive moth Eurois occulta L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) that peaked in 2005, assisted in the dating process. Climate-growth analyses were performed in two ways: first, using correlation analysis between residual site-level chronologies and monthly and seasonal climate data, and second, using linear mixed effects models (LMM) with seasonal climate data and standardized chronologies for each individual. We used climate data for the current and previous years for a given growth ring for both analyses. Both analyses revealed differences in climate-growth response among species and among sites of contrasting topography. Salix ring widths from south facing slopes correlated positively with current year's summer temperatures, while those on gentle slopes associated negatively with current year's spring precipitation. Betula was only sampled at one site (flat), and displayed associations with temperature and precipitation in spring. Results from the LMM largely corroborated the correlations for Betula and Salix on south facing slopes. Salix at the flat site displayed significant associations with a large number of climate variables, most strongly previous year's summer and autumn temperatures, though precipitation in multiple seasons of the current and prior year did a better job of accounting for the variation in the data. Many dendrochronological studies in the Arctic illustrate clear summer temperature responses, but the majority were conducted on a single topographic position. Due to the heterogeneity of West Greenland's landscapes; it is important to examine individuals from varying topographies. We found that samples collected from south facing slopes do appear to respond positively to summer temperatures, while those on shallow slopes respond to a wider array of seasonal temperature and precipitation parameters. Accounting for these species and topographic differences, when sampling, is imperative for improving our understanding of how plant communities in the Arctic will respond to ongoing and expected warming.
