H.",,,Patterns of pollen and resource limitation of fruit production in Vaccinium uliginosum and V. vitis-idaea in Interior Alaska,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many recent studies assessing fruit productivity of plants in the boreal forest focus on interannual variability across a forested region, rather than on environmental variability within the forest. Frequency and severity of wildfires in the boreal forest affect soil moisture, canopy, and community structure at the landscape level, all of which may influence overall fruit production at a site directly or indirectly. We evaluated how fruit production in two boreal shrubs,Vaccinium uliginosum(blueberry) andV.vitis-idaea(lingonberry), was explained by factors associated with resource availability (such as canopy cover and soil conditions) and pollen limitation (such as floral resources for pollinators and pollen deposition) across boreal forest sites of Interior Alaska in 2017. We classified our study sites into upland and lowland sites, which differed in elevation, soil moisture, and active layer. We found that resource and pollen limitation differed between the two species and between uplands and lowlands. Lingonberry was more pollen limited than blueberry, and plants in lowland sites were more pollen limited relative to other sites while plants in upland sites were relatively more resource limited. Additionally, canopy cover had a significant negative effect in upland sites on a ramet's investment in reproductive tissues and leaves versus structural growth, but little effect in lowland sites. These results point to importance of including pollinator service as well as resource availability in predictions for changes in berry abundance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,AUG 19,2020,15,8,,,,,,,e0224056,10.1371/journal.pone.0224056,,,,,,,WOS:000563929200016,32813718,,,,22/09/2020,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

The present study investigates ways in which ecosystem (soil and vegetation) and geomorphological (cryogenic disturbance) factors may control or affect the future release of carbon in an alpine permafrost landscape. Rates of ecosystem respiration (R-e) were examined using a portable gas analyzer across an altitudinal transect ranging from mid- to high-alpine vegetation zones underlain by discontinuous to continuous permafrost on Galdhopiggen (Norway). Measurements were made of R(e)during the peak growing season on active and relict sorted circles exhibiting varying levels of frost disturbance and shrub encroachment. R(e)was found to be controlled more strongly by soil microclimate and plant growth forms than by geomorphic indicators of cryoturbation in thawing permafrost or by atmospheric conditions. The results indicate that increasing shrub cover leads to elevated R-e, while an increase in surface disturbance has the potential to lower R-e. We conclude that vegetation is likely to colonize frost-disturbed surfaces at progressively higher altitudes as freeze-thaw processes slow down or cease, and this will result in increased R-e.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045-6740,1099-1530,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/ppp.2078,,AUG 2020,,,,,WOS:000560346700001,,,,,09/09/2020,2,empirical,ecosystem respiration,,"Jotunheimen, NO",,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Little is known, however, about the evolutionary drivers of their woodcutting behaviour. Here we investigate if early woodcutting behaviour in Castoridae was driven by nutritional needs. We measured stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of coeval subfossil plants and beaver collagen (Dipoides sp.) from the Early Pliocene, High Arctic Beaver Pond fossil locality (Ellesmere Island), in order to reconstruct Dipoides sp. diet. Isotopic evidence indicates a diet of woody plants and freshwater macrophytes, supporting the hypothesis that this extinct semiaquatic beaver engaged in woodcutting behaviour for feeding purposes. In a phylogenetic context, the isotopic evidence implies that woodcutting and consumption of woody plants can be traced back to a small-bodied, semiaquatic Miocene castorid, suggesting that beavers have been consuming woody plants for over 20 million years. We propose that the behavioural complex (swimming, woodcutting, and consuming woody plants) preceded and facilitated the evolution of dam building.

To better understand how and why vegetation growth varies in different desert areas, this study first analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, we investigated the relationship between NDVI and climatic factors (precipitation, soil water content, air temperature, evapotranspiration), and estimated the threshold NDVI under water balance in different desert areas. Results showed that the higher NDVI was mainly distributed in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Azerbaijan, and it increased in approximately 53% of desert areas from 1982 to 2015 in the whole study region. The mean annual NDVI showed a simultaneous increasing trend in all desert areas from 1982 to 1994, and decreased significantly only in the cold arid desert area (p< 0.01, -0.0067 decade(-1)) or had no significant change in other desert areas after 1994 (p> 0.01). The climate condition generally appeared as a warming and drying trend in the past 34 years, with varied changing rates in different desert areas. NDVI presented a strong positive relationship with both precipitation and evapotranspiration in most desert areas. The threshold values of the mean annual NDVI under water balance between 1982 and 2015 were approximately 0.1041 (hot arid desert), 0.1337 (cold arid desert), 0.1346 (cold arid semi-desert), 0.0951 (hot arid desert semi-desert), 0.0776 (polar desert tundra), 0.1071 (hot arid desert shrub), 0.1377 (cold arid desert steppe), and 0.0701 (polar desert steppe), respectively. The responses of these threshold values to precipitation were all positive in different desert areas.

Climate warming will stimulate the decomposition of organic matter, resulting in an increase in soil nutrient availability. However, it remains unclear how soil microorganisms in N-limited soils will respond, as the direct effect of inorganic N addition is often shown to inhibit microbial activity, while elevated N availability may have a positive effect on microorganisms indirectly, due to a stimulation of plant productivity. Here we used soils from a long-term fertilization experiment in the Subarctic (28 years at the time of sampling) to investigate the net effects of chronic N-fertilization (100 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), added together with 26 kg P and 90 kg K ha(-1) y(-1), as expected secondary limiting nutrients for plants) on microbial growth, soil C and N mineralization, microbial biomass, and community structure. Despite high levels of long-term fertilization, which significantly increased primary production, we observed relatively minor effects on soil microbial activity. Bacterial growth exhibited the most pronounced response to long-term fertilization, with higher rates of growth in fertilized soils, whereas fungal growth remained unaffected. Rates of basal soil C and N mineralization were only marginally higher in fertilized soils, whereas fertilization had no significant effect on microbial biomass or microbial community structure. Overall, these findings suggest that microbial responses to long-term fertilization in these subarctic tundra soils were driven by an increased flow of labile plant-derived C due to stimulated plant productivity, rather than by direct fertilization effects on the microbial community or changes in soil physiochemistry.",,,,"Rousk, Kathrin/H-8836-2013","Rousk, Kathrin/0000-0003-3140-9864",,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,AUG,2020,23,5,,,,,1107,1119,,10.1007/s10021-019-00458-7,,,,,,,WOS:000556248000010,,,,,09/09/2020,5,empirical,microbial growth; nutrient balance,,"Abisko, SE",,,,,,,,,,WOS search

As the Arctic warms, shrubs have been widely observed to expand, which has potentially serious consequences for global climate regulation and for the ecological processes characterising these ecosystems. However, it is currently unclear why this shrubification has been spatially uneven across the Arctic, with herbivory being suggested as a key regulating factor. By taking advantage of freely available satellite imagery spanning three decades, we mapped changes in shrub cover in the Yamal Peninsula and related these to changes in summer temperature and reindeer population size. We found no evidence that shrubs had expanded in the study site, despite increasing summer temperatures. At the same time, herbivore pressure increased significantly, with the local reindeer population size growing by about 75%. Altogether, our results thus point towards increases in large herbivore pressure having compensated for the warming of the Peninsula, halting the shrubification of the area. This suggests that strategic semi-domesticated reindeer husbandry, which is a common practice across the Eurasian Arctic, could represent an efficient environmental management strategy for maintaining open tundra landscapes in the face of rapid climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,AUG 1,2020,267,,,,,,,,110636,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110636,,,,,,,WOS:000533525100012,32421670,,,,09/09/2020,6,empirical,shrub cover change,cover,"Yamal Peninsula, RU",68.2,69.1,remote sensing,temperature; herbivory,biotic; abiotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

Wildfires are anticipated to facilitate biome shifts at the forest-tundra ecotone by improving seedbed conditions for recruiting boreal species; at the same time fire alters the composition and availability of mycorrhizal fungi critical to seedling performance. To determine the role of root-associated fungi (RAF) in post-fire seedling recruitment and future biome shifts, we outplanted four dominant boreal tree and shrub species inoculated with one of three treatments at treeline and in tundra: burned boreal forest, unburned boreal forest, or a control treatment of sterilized inoculum. We compared survivorship, growth, and physiological performance of the seedlings in relation to mycorrhizal inoculum treatment and among host species, characterized the RAF communities based on ITS-rDNA sequencing of individual root tips sampled from surviving seedlings, and tested for correlations between RAF composition and the inoculation treatments, host species, and duration of the experiment. We explored correlations between RAF composition and seedling metrics. Both live and sterile autoclaved inoculation treatments had similar effects on seedling survivorship and growth for all species. RAF composition did not vary by treatment, suggesting that most colonization was due to local fungi. However, seedling traits and growth were correlated with RAF species composition, colonization, and the relative abundance of specific RAF taxa.Piceasp. performance in particular showed strong co-variation with RAF metrics. Our results suggest that mycorrhizal co-migration is not a primary limiting factor to boreal seedling recruitment because the experimental provision of inoculum did not affect seedling recruitment; yet, RAF did influence seedling performance, particularly resident RAF at treeline and in tundra, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi are important to vegetation processes at the treeline-tundra ecotone.",,,,,"Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUL 9,2020,15,7,,,,,,,e0235932,10.1371/journal.pone.0235932,,,,,,,WOS:000552602700018,32645087,,,,09/09/2020,7,empirical,shrub and tree recruitment,recruitment and growth,"Northern Alaska, US",66.341225,-150.453978,survival and growth analysis,post-fire succession; mycorrhizal infection,biotic; abiotic,,4,community,,WOS search

Environmental conditions can co-fluctuate over large distances and thereby synchronise primary production in space. However, large-scale studies of such spatiotemporal patterns remain rare in the Arctic, where short time-series and poor spatial replication have characterised the data available on both biotic and abiotic parameters. Here, we use dendrochronological tools to measure ring growth of a dominant dwarf shrub, the polar willowSalix polaris, previously found to reliably trace community-level vascular plant biomass production. We investigated climate drivers of vegetation growth and their role in the synchronisation of primary production across the rapidly warming archipelago of Svalbard (n = 8 sites, composed of 17 sub-sites, 0.06-293 km apart). We found contrasting effects of summer versus winter weather on ring growth and its spatial synchrony. Although an overall positive effect of summer temperature caused spatially synchronous growth, negative impacts of winter rain-on-snow events occurred only locally, potentially counteracting such synchrony. However, the anticipated increase in both summer temperature and spatial extent of rain-on-snow events, causing basal ice encapsulation of the vegetation, could change the relative importance of seasons for spatiotemporal dynamics of shrub growth. Because these shrub ring growth chronologies reflect annual fluctuations in total vascular plant biomass, fuelling the bottom-up controlled food-web, these results have large implications for our understanding of how climate change shapes tundra ecosystem productivity in time and space.",,,,"Grotan, Vidar/O-9453-2019; Buchwal, Agata/F-5516-2013; Hansen, Brage/B-9942-2008","Grotan, Vidar/0000-0003-1222-0724; Buchwal, Agata/0000-0001-6879-6656; Hansen, Brage/0000-0001-8763-4361",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,JUL,2020,129,7,,,,,1012,1027,,10.1111/oik.07059,,,,,,,WOS:000544487100006,,,,,09/09/2020,8,empirical,shrub growth,growth,"Svalbard, NO",79,10,dendrochronology,temperature; precipitation; spring onset timing,abiotic,,1,species,,WOS search

It has been suggested that tree-less boreal landscapes may shift abruptly to tree-dominated states as climate warms. Yet, we insufficiently understand the conditions and mechanisms underlying tree establishment in the subarctic and arctic regions to anticipate how climate change may further affect ecosystem structure and functioning. We conducted a field experiment to assess the role of permafrost presence, micro-topography and shrub canopy on tree establishment in almost tree-less subarctic peatlands of northern Finland. We introduced seeds and seedlings of four tree-line species and monitored seedling survival and environmental conditions for six growing seasons. Our results show that once seedlings have emerged, the absence of permafrost can enhance early tree seedling survival, but shrub cover is the most important driver of subsequent tree seedling survival in subarctic peatlands. Tree seedling survival was twice as high under an intact shrub canopy than in open conditions after shrub canopy removal. Under unclipped control conditions, seedling survival was positively associated with dense shrub canopies for half of the tree species studied. These strong positive interactions between shrubs and trees may facilitate the transition from today's treeless subarctic landscapes towards tree-dominated states.

Shifts in vegetation productivity and composition in permafrost regions could influence soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover rates via rhizosphere (root zone) priming effects (RPEs), but these processes are not currently accounted for in model predictions. We use a radiocarbon (bomb-C-14) approach to test for RPEs in two Arctic tall shrubs, alder (Alnus viridis(Chaix) DC.) and birch (Betula glandulosaMichx.), and in ericaceous heath tundra vegetation. We compare surface CO(2)efflux rates and(14)C content between intact vegetation and plots in which below-ground allocation of recent photosynthate was prevented by trenching and removal of above-ground biomass. We show, for the first time, that recent photosynthate drives mineralization of older (>50 years old) SOC under birch shrubs and ericaceous heath tundra. By contrast, we find no evidence of RPEs in soils under alder. This is the first direct evidence from permafrost systems that vegetation influences SOC turnover through below-ground C allocation. The vulnerability of SOC to decomposition in permafrost systems may therefore be directly linked to vegetation change, such that expansion of birch shrubs across the Arctic could increase decomposition of older SOC.

These can cause large-scale vegetation damage, and are therefore among key drivers of declines in biomass and productivity (or browning) observed across Arctic regions in recent years. Extreme events which cause browning are driven by multiple interacting climatic variables, and are defined by their ecological impact - most commonly plant mortality. Quantifying the climatic causes of these multi-variate, ecologically defined events is challenging, and so existing work has typically determined the climatic causes of browning events on a case-by-case basis in a descriptive, unsystematic manner. While this has allowed development of important qualitative understanding of the mechanisms underlying extreme event driven browning, it cannot definitively link browning to specific climatic variables, or predict how changes in these variables will influence browning severity. It is therefore not yet possible to determine how extreme events will influence ecosystem responses to climate change across Arctic regions. To address this, novel, process-based climate metrics that can be used to quantify the conditions and interactions that drive the ecological responses defining common extreme events were developed using publicly available snow depth and air temperature data (two of the main climate variables implicated in browning). These process-based metrics explained up to 63% of variation in plot-level Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at sites within areas affected by extreme events across boreal and sub-Arctic Norway. This demonstrates potential to use simple metrics to assess the contribution of extreme events to changes in Arctic biomass and productivity at regional scales. In addition, scaling up these metrics across the Norwegian Arctic region resulted in significant correlations with remotely-sensed NDVI, and provided much-needed insights into how climatic variables interact to determine the severity of browning across Arctic regions.",,,,,"Treharne, Rachael/0000-0002-3238-5959; Bjerke, Jarle/0000-0003-2721-1492",,,,,,,,,,,,0034-4257,1879-0704,,,,JUN 15,2020,243,,,,,,,,111749,10.1016/j.rse.2020.111749,,,,,,,WOS:000528309100001,,,,,09/09/2020,11,conceptual / empirical,NDVI,browning,"Norway, NO",71,27.8,remote sensing,extreme events,abiotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

Here we focus on the circumarctic forest-tundra ecotone (FTE), which represents an important bioclimatic zone with feedbacks from forest advance and corresponding tundra disappearance (up to 50% loss predicted this century) driving widespread ecological and climatic changes. We address FTE advance and climate history relations over the 20th century, using FTE response data from 151 sites across the circumarctic area and site-specific climate data. Specifically, we investigate spatial uniformity of FTE advance, statistical associations with 20th century climate trends, and whether advance rates match climate change velocities (CCVs). Study sites diverged into four regions (Eastern Canada; Central and Western Canada and Alaska; Siberia; and Western Eurasia) based on their climate history, although all were characterized by similar qualitative patterns of behaviour (with about half of the sites showing advancing behaviour). The main associations between climate trend variables and behaviour indicate the importance of precipitation rather than temperature for both qualitative and quantitative behaviours, and the importance of non-growing season as well as growing season months. Poleward latitudinal advance rates differed significantly among regions, being smallest in Eastern Canada (similar to 10 m/year) and largest in Western Eurasia (similar to 100 m/year). These rates were 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than expected if vegetation distribution remained in equilibrium with climate. The many biotic and abiotic factors influencing FTE behaviour make poleward advance rates matching predicted 21st century CCVs (similar to 10(3)-10(4) m/year) unlikely. The lack of empirical evidence for swift forest relocation and the discrepancy between CCV and FTE response contradict equilibrium model-based assumptions and warrant caution when assessing global-change-related biotic and abiotic implications, including land-atmosphere feedbacks and carbon sequestration.",,,,"Rees, William Gareth/AAM-9701-2020; Swirad, Zuzanna M./Q-6983-2018; Cairns, David/F-3395-2014","Rees, William Gareth/0000-0001-6020-1232; Swirad, Zuzanna M./0000-0002-3592-9739; Harper, Karen/0000-0001-5390-0262; Cairns, David/0000-0003-4110-196X; Mamet, Steven/0000-0002-3510-3814",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JUL,2020,26,7,,,,,3965,3977,,10.1111/gcb.15113,,MAY 2020,,,,,WOS:000531067400001,32281711,,,,09/09/2020,12,empirical,treeline advancement,,circumpolar,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Boreal forests are dominated by tree species that overlap considerably in environmental niche, but there are few tests of what conditions initiate and sustain different forest states. Here, we examine patterns of post-fire growth and density of tree seedlings in early succession and use structural equation models to estimate relative effects of environmental and pre-fire conditions, fire characteristics, and biotic interactions. We surveyed tree seedling recruits for 13 yr across a broad range of environmental and fire conditions (n = 89) in Alaskan black spruce stands that burned in 2004. Densities of established seedlings at 13 yr were strongly determined by initial recruitment that occurred within 2 yr after fire. High proportional combustion of the soil organic layer (fire severity) led to increased densities of deciduous seedlings but not of black spruce and had a positive influence on aboveground biomass of all species. Biotic interactions such as mammalian herbivory or woody competition, potential mechanisms for relay floristic succession, had no detectable effects on tree seedling densities or biomass. Repeated surveys instead suggested persistent shifts in successional trajectories of tree communities from spruce to deciduous dominance at sites where high fire severity created positive conditions for deciduous seedling recruitment and growth. Unless future species interactions alter the deciduous dominance of tree seedling composition, the vegetation transformations that we observed in response to high fire severity are likely to persist over the short fire cycle that increasingly characterizes the fire regime of Interior Alaska.",,,,"Johnstone, Jill/C-9204-2009","Johnstone, Jill/0000-0001-6131-9339",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,MAY,2020,11,5,,,,,,,e03129,10.1002/ecs2.3129,,,,,,,WOS:000538094900013,,,,,09/09/2020,13,empirical,tree recruitment,,"Alaska, US",,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Lichens are important forage for caribou (Rangifer tarandus), whose populations are declining throughout most of North America. To clarify how lichen cover might affect caribou resource selection, ecologists require better data on the spatial distribution and abundance of lichen. Here, we use a combination of field data and satellite imagery to model lichen cover for a 583 200 km(2) area that fully encompasses nine caribou ranges in interior Alaska and Yukon. We aggregated data from in situ vegetation plots, aerial survey polygons and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to align with 30 m resolution Landsat pixels. We used these data to train a random forest model with a suite of environmental and spectral predictors to estimate lichen cover. We validated our lichen cover model using reserved training data and existing external datasets, and found that reserved data from aerial survey polygons (R-2 = 0.77) and UAV imagery (R-2 = 0.71) provided the best fit. We used our lichen cover map to evaluate the influence of estimated lichen cover on caribou resource selection in the Fortymile Herd from 2012 to 2018 during summer and winter. In both seasons, caribou avoided lichen-poor areas (0%-5% lichen cover) and showed stronger selection as lichen cover increased to similar to 30%, above which selection leveled off. Our results suggest that terrestrial lichen cover is an important factor influencing caribou resource selection in northern boreal forests across seasons. Our lichen cover map goes beyond existing maps of lichen abundance and distribution because it incorporates extensive field data for model training and validation and estimates lichen cover over a much larger spatial extent. We expect our landscape-scale map will be useful for understanding trends in lichen abundance and distribution, as well as for caribou research, management and conservation.",,,,,"Frost, Gerald/0000-0002-5134-0334; Palm, Eric/0000-0002-5330-4804; Macander, Matthew/0000-0003-2808-208X",,,,,,,,,,,,1748-9326,,,,,MAY,2020,15,5,,,,,,,55001,10.1088/1748-9326/ab6d38,,,,,,,WOS:000529892300001,,,,,09/09/2020,14,empirical,lichen cover,,"Alaska, US; Yukon, CA",,,,,,,,,,WOS search

However, shrub expansion is strongly affected by largely unknown site-specific regeneration patterns. We evaluated the importance of seed production, suitable microsite availability and seedling survival for seedling establishment of the subalpine conifer shrub Pinus mugo. Location Hruby Jesenik Mts., Czech Republic (50 degrees N, 17 degrees E). Methods We collected data on: (a) seed quantity and quality; (b) seedling microsite preferences; and (c) seedling survival during initial ontogenetic stages. From 2006 to 2016 we assessed cone production annually and tested seed viability every second year. Microsite preferences were analyzed for 650 seedlings at six sites. The following microsite characteristics were recorded for 1-m(2) around each seedling: percentage of bare surface; surrounding plant species cover; surface shape; and organic horizon thickness. Additionally, distance and direction to the nearest adult pine were recorded. Finally, we tested survival of 200 newly established seedlings in relation to microsite type. Results Seed source and viability were not critical factors for seedling establishment. Far more important was the presence of suitable bare-surface microhabitats with thin or no organic layer near mature pine stands. Vegetation communities dominated by Avenella flexuosa and Nardus stricta facilitated seedling establishment; communities dominated by Vaccinium myrtillus showed strong competitive effects on seedlings. Vegetation's effect on seedling establishment was closely related to disturbance regime, which influences vegetation type. Seedling mortality was highest in the first year of life irrespective of microsite vegetation type. Highest mortality was associated with open mineral-soil microsites, while microsites with dense herbaceous vegetation showed the lowest.

We used a 19 year moose location dataset, a 568 km transect of field shrub sampling, and forecasted warming scenarios with regional downscaling to map current and projected shrub habitat for moose on the North Slope of Alaska. The tall-shrub habitat for moose exhibited a dendritic spatial configuration correlated with river corridor networks and mean July temperature. Warming scenarios predict that moose habitat will more than double by 2099. Forecasted warming is predicted to increase the spatial cohesion of the habitat network that diminishes effects of fragmentation, which improves overall habitat quality and likely expands the range of moose.

Plant hormones play specific roles in tree-ring formation depending on the developmental zone in which they operate. Tree rings are the result of the seasonal activity of the vascular cambium, the secondary meristem of woody angiosperms and gymnosperms. During tree-ring formation, a combination of endogenous and environmental factors affects cambial division, cell differentiation and maturation; this, in turn, affects wood quantity and quality. Among the endogenous factors affecting tree-ring formation, plant hormones are recognized as determinant players in regulating many aspects of the features and fate of each xylem cell. Most of our knowledge regarding the roles of plant hormones on tree-ring formation comes from herbaceous plants, although an increasing interest involves the analysis of the hormonal patterns in tree-species. This paper reviews the state of knowledge of the role of plant hormones during tree-ring formation by focusing on experiments performed on woody species. An overview of the main plant hormones and their main activities during radial tree growth will be followed by discussion of their role in each tree-ring developmental stage and in the overall tree-ring seasonal pattern.",,,,"Shishov, Vladimir/I-6256-2013","Shishov, Vladimir/0000-0001-8850-6142; Butto, Valentina/0000-0003-1595-6745",,,,,,,,,,,,0931-1890,1432-2285,,,,APR,2020,34,2,,,,,315,335,,10.1007/s00468-019-01940-4,,,,,,,WOS:000527948200001,,,,,09/09/2020,17,review,tree ring formation,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

However, only a very small number of studies exist so far using annually resolved records of alpine plant growth spanning the past century. Here we aimed to identify the effects of heat waves and drought, driven by global warming, on annual radial growth of Rhododendron ferrugineum. Methods We constructed two century-long shrub ring-width chronologies from R. ferrugineum individuals on two adjacent, north- and west-facing slopes in the southern French Alps. We analyzed available meteorological data (temperature, precipitation and drought) over the period 1960-2016. Climate-growth relationships were evaluated using bootstrapped correlation functions and structural equation models to identify the effects of rising temperature on shrub growth. Results Analysis of meteorological variables during 1960-2016 revealed a shift in the late 1980s when heat waves and drought increased in intensity and frequency. In response to these extreme climate events, shrubs have experienced significant changes in their main limiting factors. Between 1960 and 1988, radial growth on both slopes was strongly controlled by the sum of growing degree days during the snow free period. Between 1989 and 2016, August temperature and drought have emerged as the most important. Conclusions Increasing air temperatures have caused a shift in the growth response of shrubs to climate.

The strong feedbacks between carbon-rich permafrost, climate and herbivory suggest an NCS consisting of reverting the current wet/moist moss and shrub-dominated tundra and the sparse forest-tundra ecotone to grassland through a guild of large herbivores. Grassland-dominated systems might delay permafrost thaw and reduce carbon emissions-especially in Yedoma regions, while increasing carbon capture through increased productivity and grass and forb deep root systems. Here we review the environmental context of megafaunal ecological engineering in the Arctic; explore the mechanisms through which it can help mitigate climate change; and estimate its potential-based on bison and horse, with the aim of evaluating the feasibility of generating an ecosystem shift that is economically viable in terms of carbon benefits and of sufficient scale to play a significant role in global climate change mitigation.

Zigzag-shaped shoots have been selected and thoroughly studied in Arabidopsis; however, the regulatory mechanism underlying zigzag-shaped shoot development in other plants, especially woody plants, is largely unknown. Results In this study, tea plants with zigzag-shaped shoots, namely, Qiqu (QQ) and Lianyuanqiqu (LYQQ), were investigated and compared with the erect-shoot tea plant Meizhan (MZ) in an attempt to reveal the regulation of zigzag-shaped shoot formation. Tissue section observation showed that the cell arrangement and shape of zigzag-shaped stems were aberrant compared with those of normal shoots. Moreover, a total of 2175 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from the zigzag-shaped shoots of the tea plants QQ and LYQQ compared to the shoots of MZ using transcriptome sequencing, and the DEGs involved in the Plant-pathogen interaction, Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, Flavonoid biosynthesis and Linoleic acid metabolism pathways were significantly enriched. Additionally, the DEGs associated with cell expansion, vesicular trafficking, phytohormones, and transcription factors were identified and analysed. Metabolomic analysis showed that 13 metabolites overlapped and were significantly changed in the shoots of QQ and LYQQ compared to MZ.

Building on initial pollen studies, we provide a more complete record and a more detailed discussion of climatically-driven vegetation and environmental changes in the northeastern Russian Arctic, spanning the 203-thousand-year interval between 3.383 and 3.180 Ma ago. Pine-spruce-fir-larch-Douglas fir forests dominated the area around Lake El'gygytgyn between 3.383 and 3.330 Ma (MIS MG4 - MIS MG2).

Climate conditions were similar or only slightly warmer and wetter to those of the Holocene. Numerous coprophilous fungi spores identified in the MIS M2 pollen samples suggest the presence of grazing mammals around the lake.

Hence, when monitoring ecosystem states and changes thereof, the vegetation is often a primary monitoring target. Here, we summarize current understanding of vegetation change in the High Arctic-the World's most rapidly warming region-in the context of ecosystem monitoring. To foster development of deployable monitoring strategies, we categorize different kinds of drivers (disturbances or stresses) of vegetation change either as pulse (i.e. drivers that occur as sudden and short events, though their effects may be long lasting) or press (i.e. drivers where change in conditions remains in place for a prolonged period, or slowly increases in pressure). To account for the great heterogeneity in vegetation responses to climate change and other drivers, we stress the need for increased use of ecosystem-specific conceptual models to guide monitoring and ecological studies in the Arctic. We discuss a conceptual model with three hypothesized alternative vegetation states characterized by mosses, herbaceous plants, and bare ground patches, respectively. We use moss-graminoid tundra of Svalbard as a case study to discuss the documented and potential impacts of different drivers on the possible transitions between those states. Our current understanding points to likely additive effects of herbivores and a warming climate, driving this ecosystem from a moss-dominated state with cool soils, shallow active layer and slow nutrient cycling to an ecosystem with warmer soil, deeper permafrost thaw, and faster nutrient cycling. Herbaceous-dominated vegetation and (patchy) bare ground would present two states in response to those drivers. Conceptual models are an operational tool to focus monitoring efforts towards management needs and identify the most pressing scientific questions. We promote greater use of conceptual models in conjunction with a state-and-transition framework in monitoring to ensure fit for purpose approaches.

Biomes whose extents are limited by temperature or precipitation, such as the tundra and savanna, may be particularly strongly affected by climate change. While woody plant encroachment is prevalent across both biomes, its relationship to temperature and precipitation change remains unknown. Here, we quantify the degree to which woody encroachment is related to climate change and identify its main associated drivers. Location Tundra and savanna biomes. Time period 1992 +/- 20.27-2010 +/- 5.62 (mean +/- SD). 1876-2016 (range). Major taxa studied Woody plants (shrubs and trees). Methods We compiled a dataset comprising 1,089 records from 899 sites of woody plant cover over time and attributed drivers of woody cover change across these two biomes. We calculated cover change in each biome and assessed the degree to which cover change corresponds to concurrent temperature and precipitation changes using multiple climate metrics. Finally, we conducted a quantitative literature review of the relative importance of attributed drivers of woody cover change. Results Woody encroachment was widespread geographically and across climate gradients. Rates of woody cover change (positive or negative) were 1.8 times lower in the tundra than in the savanna (1.8 vs. 3.2%), while rates of woody cover increase (i.e., encroachment) were c. 1.7 times lower in the tundra compared with the savanna (3.7 vs. 6.3% per decade). In the tundra, magnitudes of woody cover change did not correspond to climate, while in the savanna, greater cover change corresponded with increases in precipitation. We found higher rates of woody cover change in wetter versus drier sites with warming in the tundra biome, and higher rates of woody cover change in drier versus wetter sites with increasing precipitation in the savanna. However, faster rates of woody cover change were not associated with more rapid rates of climate change across sites, except for maximum precipitation in the savanna. Main conclusions Woody encroachment was positively related to warming in the tundra and increased rainfall in the savanna. However, cover change rates were not predicted by rates of climate change, which can be partially explained by climate interactions in both biomes. Additional likely influences include site-level factors, time-lags, plant-specific responses, and land use and other non-climate drivers.

However, the community-level processes driving vegetation change are poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate factors mediating the assembly processes for community initiators of vegetation change and determine the ecological processes driving vegetation changes. Location Kuujjuarapik/Whapmagoostui (55.31 N, 77.75 W), Quebec, Canada. Methods Vegetation was surveyed in eight 100-m line transects with 16 quadrats (1 m x 1 m) per transect established in both forest and tundra habitats. To elucidate the assembly processes of the initiators of vegetation change and other community components of the forest-tundra ecotone, we evaluated beta-diversity among and within habitats and its causal factors (i.e. spatial and environmental factors). Interspecies interactions were estimated based on the patterns of co-occurrence between all pairs of species. Results Although environmental and spatial factors significantly affected the community structure of the specific and shared species in the forest habitat, the variation in community structure within and among tundra habitats was not explained by environmental or spatial factors for any community components. Therefore, community assemblages of shared species in tundra habitat were independent from local conditions determined by environment and spatial location. However, we found a positive co-occurrence pattern among the dominant shared shrubs to be a characteristic of the tundra habitat, and this relationship explained the patterns of community structure within tundra habitats. Conclusions Community assemblages of initiators of vegetation change in tundra habitats are unrestricted by any external factors, such as dispersal limitation or environmental filtering. However, positive relationships in the abundance or occurrence of dominant shrubs may indicate a positive feedback loop between colonizing species and environmental modifications. This positive feedback loop may be a driving process in the expansion of shared species and vegetation change.",,,,"Mori, Akira S/A-6570-2013","Mori, Akira S/0000-0002-8422-1198",,,,,,,,,,,,1100-9233,1654-1103,,,,MAR,2020,31,2,,,,,234,244,,10.1111/jvs.12818,,JAN 2020,,,,,WOS:000508192500001,,,,,09/09/2020,27,empirical,plant community structure,abundance,"Québec, C",55.31,-77.75,vegetation surveys,shrub co-occurrence,biotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

Yet, predicting changes in soil carbon is hindered by the fact that multiple factors simultaneously control processes sustaining carbon storage and we do not understand how they act in concert. Here, we investigated the effects of warmer temperatures, enhanced soil nitrogen availability, and the combination of these on tundra carbon stocks at three different grazing regimes: on areas with over 50-yr history of either light or heavy reindeer grazing and in 5-yr-old exlosures in the heavily grazed area. In line with earlier reports, warming generally decreased soil carbon stocks. However, our results suggest that the mechanisms by which warming decreases carbon storage depend on grazing intensity: under long-term light grazing soil carbon losses were linked to higher shrub abundance and higher enzymatic activities, whereas under long-term heavy grazing, carbon losses were linked to drier soils and higher enzymatic activities. Importantly, under enhanced soil nitrogen availability, warming did not induce soil carbon losses under either of the long-term grazing regimes, whereas inside exclosures in the heavily grazed area, also the combination of warming and enhanced nutrient availability induced soil carbon loss. Grazing on its own did not influence the soil carbon stocks. These results reveal that accounting for the effect of warming or grazing alone is not sufficient to reliably predict future soil carbon storage in the tundra. Instead, the joint effects of multiple global changes need to be accounted for, with a special focus given to abrupt changes in grazing currently taking place in several parts of the Arctic.",,,,,"Vaisanen, Maria/0000-0001-9055-8443",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,,,FEB,2020,90,1,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecm.1396,,DEC 2019,,,,,WOS:000501369900001,,,,,09/09/2020,30,empirical,soil carbon stocks,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In our study setting, replacing the laser scanningbased and hydraulic modelling-based variables with a proxy variable elevation did not significantly weaken the models. However, using directly measured and modelled variables allows relating species patterns to e.g. stream power or the length of the flood-free period. Substituting these biologically relevant variables with proxies mask important processes and may reduce the transferability of the results into other sites. At the local scale, the amount of litter is a highly important driver of total species richness, distribution and abundance patterns (relative influences 49, 72 and 83%, respectively) and across all functional groups (13-57%; excluding lichen species richness) in the sub-arctic river valley. Moreover, soil organic matter and soil water content shape vegetation patterns (on average 16 and 7%, respectively). Fluvial disturbance is a key limiting factor only for lichen, bryophyte and dwarf shrub species in this environment (on average 37, 6 and 10%, respectively). Fluvial disturbance intensity is the most important component of disturbance for most functional groups while the length of the disturbance-free period is more relevant for lichens.

The response of mountain hydrology to vegetation/soil changes in the present and a future climate was modeled in three snowmelt-dominated mountain basins in the North American Cordillera. The models developed for each basin using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modeling platform employed current and expected changes to vegetation and soil parameters and were driven with recent and perturbed high-altitude meteorological observations. Monthly perturbations were calculated using the differences in outputs between the present- and a future-climate scenario from 11 regional climate models. In the three basins, future climate change alone decreased the modeled peak snow water equivalent (SWE) by 11 %-47 % and increased the modeled evapotranspiration by 14 %-20 %. However, including future changes in vegetation and soil for each basin changed or reversed these climate change outcomes. In Wolf Creek in the Yukon Territory, Canada, a statistically insignificant increase in SWE due to vegetation increase in the alpine zone was found to offset the statistically significant decrease in SWE due to climate change. In Marmot Creek in the Canadian Rockies, the increase in annual runoff due to the combined effect of soil and climate change was statistically significant, whereas their individual effects were not. In the relatively warmer Reynolds Mountain in Idaho, USA, vegetation change alone decreased the annual runoff volume by 8 %, but changes in soil, climate, or both did not affect runoff. At high elevations in Wolf and Marmot creeks, the model results indicated that vegetation/soil changes moderated the impact of climate change on peak SWE, the timing of peak SWE, evapotranspiration, and the annual runoff volume. However, at medium elevations, these changes intensified the impact of climate change, further decreasing peak SWE and sublimation. The hydrological impacts of changes in climate, vegetation, and soil in mountain environments were similar in magnitude but not consistent in direction for all biomes; in some combinations, this resulted in enhanced impacts at lower elevations and latitudes and moderated impacts at higher elevations and latitudes.",,,,"Pomeroy, John W/A-8589-2013","Pomeroy, John W/0000-0002-4782-7457; Rasouli, Kabir/0000-0002-8176-2132",,,,,,,,,,,,1027-5606,1607-7938,,,,DEC 3,2019,23,12,,,,,4933,4954,,10.5194/hess-23-4933-2019,,,,,,,WOS:000500958500001,,,,,09/09/2020,32,modelling,hydrology,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Their spread is often associated with increases in temperature and other abiotic factors, while variation in habitat moisture and herbivory can mediate the location and rate of this rise in abundance. Much less is known about the mode of increase of arctic shrubs. For one such shrub, Salix glauca, we used microsatellite markers to assess the prevalence of clonal growth (i.e. vegetative spread) and sexual reproduction (i.e. recruitment from seed) at sites with maritime and continental climates and differing in the density of large herbivores. We sampled individuals in plots reflecting the spatial scale of expansion in locations where S. glauca recently increased in abundance. The 400 samples collected across the four sites comprised 310 genotypes. Though evidence of sexual recruitment was common across all sites, coastal sites contained both more and larger clonal genotypes. While we expected soil conditions would be influential, the factors that best predicted the likelihood of clonality, genet size and vascular plant cover, suggest the light environment is of primary importance. Furthermore, in spite of the large distances between sites, there was no suggestion of genetic differentiation into distinct populations. These results indicate that differences in climate and herbivory can influence not only where and how extensively deciduous shrubs spread, but how they are likely to do so.

Numerous studies have focused on spatial patterns and mechanisms of this phenomenon, especially in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. Greening trends in the European Alps have received less attention, although this region has experienced strong climate and land-use changes during recent decades. We studied the rates and spatial patterns of greening in an inner-alpine region of the Western Alps. We used MODIS-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at 8-day temporal and 250 m spatial resolution, for the period 2000-2018, and removed areas with disturbances in order to consider the trends of undisturbed vegetation. The objectives of this study were to (i) quantify trends of greening in a representative area of the Western Alps; and (ii) examine mechanisms and causes of spatial patterns of greening across different plant types. We show that 63% of vegetated areas experienced significant trends during the 2000-2018 period, of which only 8% were negative. We identify (i) a climatic control on spring and autumn phenology with contrasting effects depending on plant type and elevation, and (ii) land-use change dynamics, such as shrub encroachment on abandoned pastures and colonization of new surfaces at high elevation. Below 1500 m, warming temperatures promote incremental greening in the transition from spring to summer, but not in fall, suggesting either photoperiod or water limitation. In the alpine and sub-alpine belts (>1800 m asl), snow prevents vegetation development until late spring, despite favorable temperatures. Instead, at high elevation greening acts both in summer and autumn. However, photoperiod limitation likely prevents forested ecosystems from fully exploiting warmer autumn conditions. We furthermore illustrate two emblematic cases of prominent greening: recent colonization of previously glaciated/non vegetated areas, as well as shrub/tree encroachment due to the abandonment of agricultural practices.

The interplay of changes in winter climate and plant presence may alter soil functioning via effects on decomposers. Responses of decomposer soil fauna and microorganisms to such changes likely differ from each other, since their life histories, dispersal mechanisms and microhabitats vary greatly. We investigated the relative impacts of short-term winter warming and increases in plant cover on bacteria and collembola community composition in cryoturbated, non-sorted circle tundra. By covering non-sorted circles with insulating gardening fibre cloth (fleeces) or using stone walls accumulating snow, we imposed two climate-change scenarios: snow accumulation increased autumn-to-late winter soil temperatures (-1 cm) by 1.4 degrees C, while fleeces warmed soils during that period by 1 degrees C and increased spring temperatures by 1.1 degrees C. Summer bacteria and collembola communities were sampled from within-circle locations differing in vegetation abundance and soil properties. Two years of winter warming had no effects on either decomposer community. Instead, their community compositions were strongly determined by sampling location: communities in barren circle centres were distinct from those in vegetated outer rims, while communities in sparsely vegetated patches of circle centres were intermediate. Diversity patterns indicate that collembola communities are tightly linked to plant presence while bacteria communities correlated with soil properties. Our results thus suggest that direct effects of short-term winter warming are likely to be minimal, but that vegetation encroachment on barren cryoturbated ground will affect decomposer community composition substantially. At decadal timescales, collembola community changes may follow relatively fast after warming-driven plant establishment into barren areas, whereas bacteria communities may take longer to respond. If shifts in decomposer community composition are indicative for changes in their activity, vegetation overgrowth will likely have much stronger effects on soil functioning in frost-affected tundra than short-term winter warming.",,,,"Weedon, James/AAA-9064-2019; Monteux, Sylvain/W-4957-2019; Weedon, James/C-5473-2008","Monteux, Sylvain/0000-0001-9923-2036; Krab, Eveline/0000-0001-8262-0198; Weedon, James/0000-0003-0491-8719",,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0717,,,,,NOV,2019,138,,,,,,,,107569,10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.107569,,,,,,,WOS:000495519900007,,,,,09/09/2020,35,empirical,bacteria and collembola community composition,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

While increased evapotranspiration (ET) in response to increased atmospheric demand seems intuitive, plants are capable of reducing ET in response to increased VPD by closing their stomata. We examine which effect dominates the response to increasing VPD: atmospheric demand and increases in ET or plant response (stomata closure) and decreases in ET. We use Penman-Monteith, combined with semiempirical optimal stomatal regulation theory and underlying water use efficiency, to develop a theoretical framework for assessing ET response to VPD. The theory suggests that depending on the environment and plant characteristics, ET response to increasing VPD can vary from strongly decreasing to increasing, highlighting the diversity of plant water regulation strategies. The ET response varies due to (1) climate, with tropical and temperate climates more likely to exhibit a positive ET response to increasing VPD than boreal and arctic climates; (2) photosynthesis strategy, with C3 plants more likely to exhibit a positive ET response than C4 plants; and (3) plant type, with crops more likely to exhibit a positive ET response, and shrubs and gymniosperm trees more likely to exhibit a negative ET response. These results, derived from previous literature connecting plant parameters to plant and climate characteristics, highlight the utility of our simplified framework for understanding complex land-atmosphere systems in terms of idealized scenarios in which ET responds to VPD only.

The pronounced interspecies and temporal variability of thermal constraints revealed the thermal niches were much more nuanced and variable than they have commonly been represented.

By using time series of 30 m imagery, we characterize dynamics in forest and shrub cover occurring at relatively short spatial scales (hundreds of meters) due to fires, harvest, and climate-induced growth that are not observable in coarse spatial resolution (e.g., 500 m or greater pixel size) imagery. Wildfires caused most of Evergreen Forest Loss and Evergreen Forest Gain and substantial areas of Deciduous Forest Gain. Extensive shifts in the distribution of plant functional types at multiple spatial scales are consistent with observations of increased atmospheric CO2 seasonality and ecosystem productivity at northern high-latitudes and signal continental-scale shifts in the structure and function of northern high-latitude ecosystems in response to climate change.",,,,"Wang, Jonathan/J-3390-2019","Wang, Jonathan/0000-0003-2839-0699; Sulla-Menashe, Damien/0000-0002-0435-6114",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,FEB,2020,26,2,,,,,807,822,,10.1111/gcb.14804,,SEP 2019,,,,,WOS:000486743500001,31437337,,,,09/09/2020,39,empirical,land cover change,cover,"Alaska, US; Yukon, CA",,,remote sensing,disturbance; climate,abiotic,,,community,,WOS search

Our objective was to quantify metal accumulation capacities for plant species and functional groups common to Alaskan military training ranges where elevated soil metal concentrations were likely to occur. Plant species across multiple military training range sites were collected. Metal content in shoots and roots was compared to soil metal concentrations to calculate bioconcentration and translocation factors. On average, grasses accumulated greater concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Zn relative to forbs or shrubs, and bioconcentrated greater concentrations of Ni and Pb. Shrubs bioconcentrated greater concentrations of Sb. Translocation to shoots was greatest among the forbs. Three native plants were identified as candidate species for use in metal phytostabilization applications. Elymus macrourus, a grass, bioconcentrated substantial concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn in roots with low translocation to shoots. Elaeagnus commutata, a shrub, bioconcentrated the greatest amounts of Sb, Ni, and Cr, with a low translocation factor.

Fire is also projected to increase with warming(2,3). We show here, consistent with changes during the Holocene(4), that changes in twenty-first century climate and fire are likely to alter the composition of Alaskan boreal forests. We hypothesize that competition for nutrients after fire in early succession and for light in late succession in a warmer climate will cause shifts in plant functional type. Consistent with observations, our ecosystem model predicts evergreen conifers to be the current dominant tree type in Alaska. However, under future climate and fire, our analysis suggests the relative dominance of deciduous broadleaf trees nearly doubles, accounting for 58% of the Alaska ecosystem's net primary productivity by 2100, with commensurate declines in contributions from evergreen conifer trees and herbaceous plants. Post-fire deciduous broadleaf tree growth under a future climate is sustained from enhanced microbial nitrogen mineralization caused by warmer soils and deeper active layers, resulting in taller trees that compete more effectively for light. The expansion of deciduous broadleaf forests will affect the carbon cycle, surface energy fluxes and ecosystem function, thereby modifying important feedbacks with the climate system.",,,,"Mekonnen, Zelalem/M-7144-2017; Riley, William J/D-3345-2015","Mekonnen, Zelalem/0000-0002-2647-0671; Riley, William J/0000-0002-4615-2304",,,,,,,,,,,,2055-026X,2055-0278,,,,SEP,2019,5,9,,,,,952,958,,10.1038/s41477-019-0495-8,,,,,,,WOS:000485155000013,31451797,,,,09/09/2020,41,modelling,boreal forest composition,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

However, there is no consensus regarding determinant factors of species clonality; especially in the context of species assembly processes, ecological/evolutionary drivers of clonal growth remain largely unknown. To elucidate macroecological drivers of clonality, we examined phylogenetic conservatism/convergence of clonal growth in Japanese vascular plants and explored the ecological role of clonality. We created a dataset of clonal plants that were classified into phalanx, guerrilla and detachable clonal forms for 3,179 species, along with data regarding species geographical distributions and phylogenies. Then, we tested the association of phylogenetic and environmental factors with species clonality for three life-form groups (fern, herb and woody species), and identified explanatory factors of clonal growth along large-scale environmental gradients. Species clonality was phylogenetically constrained; specifically, for herb and woody species, phylogenetic signals across all the clonal growth forms, or especially the detachable form in ferns, were significant. Moreover, clonal growth of Japanese vascular plants was largely explained by taxonomic levels, and also partly by temperature, soil fertility, and species diversity in the distribution range, suggesting both processes; taxon-dependent evolution of vascular plant clonality and evolutionary convergence of clonality across multiple clades of vascular plants relative to environmental constraints.

Large, often remote fires necessitate large-scale estimates of fire effects and consequences, often using Landsat satellite-derived dNBR (differenced Normalized Burn Ratio) to estimate burn severity. However, few studies have examined long-term field measures of ecosystem condition in relation to dNBR severity classes in boreal Alaska, USA. The goals of this study were: 1) assess changes in dominant vegetation at plots resampled one and 12 years post fire; 2) use dNBR classes to characterize vegetation and downed woody fuels 12 years post fire; and 3) characterize the relationship between biophysical, topographic, and remotely sensed characteristics (e.g., moss and duff depth, canopy cover, elevation, aspect, dNBR) and understory species assemblages 12 years post fire. Results Understory species richness doubled (from 39 to 73) between 2005 and 2016; some common species increased in cover over time (e.g., Ledum groenlandicum Oeder) while others decreased (e.g., Hylocomium splendens [Hedw.] Schimp.). In 2016, live and dead tree densities, tall shrub cover, and 1- and 100-h woody fuels were significantly different among dNBR classes; moss and duff depth, canopy cover, and spruce seedling density were not. Elevation and aspect significantly influenced tall shrub cover, hardwood sapling density, and downed woody fuel loads. Understory plant communities differed between unburned and all burn classes, as well as between low and high dNBR severity. Ordination analysis showed that overstory (e.g., live tree density), understory (e.g., moss depth, woody fuel loading), and site (elevation, aspect, dNBR) significantly influences understory species assemblages. Conclusion Remeasured sites (sampled one and 12 years post fire) showed recruitment of new understory species and differing, diverse responses to burning by several common plant species. In 2016, low-severity burned sites had generally the highest woody fuel loading, which may increase risk of repeated surface burning, although the reduction in live tree density would still result in decreased fire risk and behavior. Understory community composition correlated with multiple biotic and abiotic factors, including moss depth, canopy cover, elevation, aspect, and dNBR. Overall, our findings can improve landscape-level predictions of ecosystem condition following fire based on dNBR.",,,,"Hammond, Darcy/L-9608-2019","Hammond, Darcy/0000-0003-3200-0833",,,,,,,,,,,,1933-9747,,,,,AUG 26,2019,15,1,,,,,,,32,10.1186/s42408-019-0049-5,,,,,,,WOS:000482767100001,,,,,09/09/2020,43,empirical,vegetation composition; fuel availability,cover,"Central Alaska, US",63.74,-142.26,vegetation surveys,fire intensity,abiotic,,4,community,,WOS search

Specifically, herbaceous plant groups and those with far northern geographic distributions centered in Beringia may have persisted coincident with repeated diminution of tall-statured and southern continental plant groups during cold intervals, thus potentially structuring current diversity patterns in relation to elevation. Numerous biotic and abiotic drivers of plant species distributions vary with elevation, raising questions concerning which of these drivers are responsible for these surprising diversity patterns. We used structural equation modeling to investigate relationships among a suite of biotic and abiotic covariates and the richness of species groups based on growth form (GF) and biogeographic affinity across interior Alaska. Our results confirm the primary importance of microclimate in controlling the distribution, abundance, and richness of woody plants, which increased in warm, south-exposed plots. In contrast, the suite of other site factors had considerably stronger combined direct influences on richness of forbs, graminoids, and dwarf shrubs as compared to microclimate. Thus, species groups with negative richness responses to increasing temperature and potential solar radiation may have a competitive disadvantage to woody species, suggesting competitive displacement as one mechanism for these patterns. Our findings reveal that conditions associated with the high plant diversity (including cooler air temperatures, ground disturbance, and weakly acidic soil pH) are spatially restricted as compared to widespread conditions associated with low species diversity (warm lowlands with acidic soil reaction). Our results confirm a strong correspondence between localized richness patterns and variation in the overall fractions of the GF and biogeographic groups within the regional species pool. Our work suggests important links between current and historical drivers of plant diversity that help explain the apparent contradictions suggested by the relatively limited spatial extent of species-rich habitats in Alaska. By elucidating the relationships among biotic and abiotic site characteristics and between these characteristics and richness, our findings provide a useful framework within which to evaluate possible changes to vegetation structure and species richness patterns caused by rapid warming.",,,,"Sadoti, Giancarlo/A-3138-2011","Sadoti, Giancarlo/0000-0003-3191-8167",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,AUG,2019,10,8,,,,,,,e02832,10.1002/ecs2.2832,,,,,,,WOS:000483832300022,,,,,09/09/2020,44,empirical / modelling,species diversity,species richness,"Alaska, US",65.04,-141.05,vegetation surveys; SEM,temperature; elevation; slope; EQ; soil depth; soil PH; site moisture; ground disturbance; canopy cover; tree BA,biotic; abiotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

However, the effect of high arctic herbivores on vegetation dynamics throughout a growing season is not well understood. In this study, we examine the impacts of a large dominant herbivore in the tundra ecosystem, the muskox, Ovibos moschatus, using exclosures established in a fen in high Arctic Greenland. Using weekly sampling throughout the growing season, we quantified the effects of muskox exclusion on aboveground plant biomass and on concentrations and pools of carbon and nitrogen, and explored the timing of peak biomass and nutrient pools. Excluding muskoxen profoundly changed plant abundances and dynamics of the fen, with more than a doubling of aboveground plant biomass and carbon and nitrogen pool sizes. Specifically, large increases in mosses and litter were observed, while graminoid biomass did not change significantly with exclusion of muskoxen. Excluding muskoxen advanced the peak of plant biomass, but also led to a more rapid decline, resulting in an earlier and shorter period of maximal plant biomass inside the exclosures. The largest impact of muskoxen on the arctic fen ecosystem seems to be through their trampling effects on the moss layer, which likely mediated most of the observed changes.

Alongside the vegetation change, several features of ecosystem functioning, such as ecosystem carbon sink capacity and soil carbon mineralisation rates, may be altered. It has remained largely uninvestigated how the grazing effects on carbon cycling processes depend on the duration of grazing. Here, we hypothesised that grazing affects ecosystem carbon sink through plant-driven processes (for example, photosynthesis) on shorter time-scales, whereas on longer time-scales changes in soil-driven processes (for example, microbial activity) become more important contributing to a decreased carbon sink capacity. To test this hypothesis, we investigated key processes behind ecosystem carbon cycling in an area that recently had become dominated by graminoids due to a high reindeer grazing intensity and compared these to the processes in an area of decades old grazing-induced graminoid dominance and in an area of shrub dominance with little grazer influence. In contrast to our hypothesis, areas of both old and recent grassification showed a similar carbon sink capacity. Yet the individual fluxes varied depending on the time passed since the vegetation shift: ecosystem respiration and mid-season photosynthesis were higher under old than recent grassification. In contrast, the extracellular enzyme activities for carbon and phosphorus acquisition were similar regardless of the time elapsed since grazer-induced vegetation change. These results provide novel understanding on how ecosystem processes develop over time in response to changes in the intensity of herbivory. Moreover, they indicate that both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes are controlled through multiple drivers that likely change depending on the duration of herbivory.",,,,"Ylanne, Henni/I-1579-2019","Ylanne, Henni/0000-0002-0842-6757",,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,AUG,2019,22,5,,,,,1145,1159,,10.1007/s10021-018-0329-y,,,,,,,WOS:000480546800015,,,,,09/09/2020,46,empirical,carbon sink capacity,,"Raisduoddar, NO",,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Methods: We surveyed plant community composition and cover at four sampling time points over a forty-year span (1971-2011). Results: We observed an expansion of shrub cover, both within the shrub tundra and encroaching into moist and dry meadow communities. This shrub cover expansion coincides with increased litter and decreased species richness at the plot level. Overall, despite some shifts in functional group cover and species richness, plant community composition remained mostly intact across forty years.

Specifically, we evaluated whether population differentiation varies across environments and whether P x E is determined by aspects of the study system and experimental design. Location Global. Methods We conducted a literature search in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database to identify studies assessing population differentiation in a climate change context. We quantified the occurrence of P x E and performed a meta-analysis to calculate the percentage of traits showing P x E in the study cases. Results We identified 309 study cases (from 237 published articles) assessing population differentiation in 172 plant species, of which 64% included more than one test environment and tested P x E. In 77% of these studies, P x E was significant for at least one functional trait. The overall proportion of traits showing P x E was 33.4% (95% confidence interval 27.7-39.3). These results were generally consistent across life-forms, ecoregions and type of experiment. Furthermore, population differentiation varied across test environments in 76% of cases.

Location Dovre Mountains, Central Norway. Methods Shrub growth (height and cover) and ground layer composition were analysed each third year over an 18-year period in a nested, three-factorial experiment (ambient temperature and herbivory; ambient temperature and no herbivory; increased temperature and no herbivory). Fencing and open-top-chambers were used as expedients. Treatment effects and interactions over time were analysed using linear mixed effects models and ordination. Results Shrub height and cover increased over time due to reduced herbivory, but without additional warming effect. Lichen cover declined in all treatments over time, but more rapidly and earlier under warming treatment (significant after three years). Contrary to expectations, there was no statistically significant increase in woody species due to warming, although evergreen woody species displayed a trend shift after six years, comprising a sharp decline towards year twelve. Litter accumulated in all treatments, but at higher rates under warming (significant after nine years). Conclusions Our results disclose removal of sheep herbivory as a prominent driver of shrub growth, with warming as a subordinate driver in the studied alpine vegetation. The warming-driven increased litter abundance may, however, be caused by the decrease of wind inside chambers and the subsequent absence of wind-driven removal of litter.

With warming and drought during the growing season, insect-driven defoliation is expected to increase in frequency and severity with potential broad-scale impacts on tundra ecosystem functioning. Here we provide the first broad-scale reconstruction of spatio-temporal dynamics of past insect outbreaks by assessing their effects on shrub growth along a typical Greenlandic fjord climate gradient from the inland ice to the sea. Location Nuuk Fjord (64 degrees 30 ' N/51 degrees 23 ' W) and adjacent areas, West Greenland. Taxa Great brocade (Eurois occulta L.) and grey willow (Salix glauca L.). Methods We combined dendro-anatomical and remote sensing analyses. Time series of ring width (RW) and wood-anatomical traits were obtained from chronologies of >40 years established from 153 individuals of S. glauca collected at nine sites. We detected anomalies in satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) related to defoliation and reconstructed past changes in photosynthetic activity across the region. Results We identified outbreaks as distinctive years with reduced RW, cell-wall thickness and vessel size, without being directly related to climate but matching with years of parallel reduction in NDVI. The two subsequent years after the defoliation showed a significant increase in RW. The reconstructed spatio-temporal dynamics of these events indicate substantial regional variation in outbreak intensity linked to the climate variability across the fjord system. Main conclusions Our results highlight the ability of S. glauca to cope with severe insect defoliation by changing carbon investment and xylem conductivity leading to high resilience and rapid recovery after the disturbance. Our multiproxy approach allows us to pinpoint biotic drivers of narrow ring formation and to provide new broad-scale insight on the C-budget and vegetation productivity of shrub communities in a widespread arctic ecosystem.",,,,"Normand, Signe/A-1561-2012; Carrer, Marco/D-8727-2011; /I-5902-2019; Pedersen, Nanna B./C-9880-2015; Pedersen, Nanna Bjerregaard/AAA-1525-2020; Treier, Urs/A-1913-2012; Elberling, Bo/M-4000-2014","Normand, Signe/0000-0002-8782-4154; Carrer, Marco/0000-0003-1581-6259; /0000-0002-5809-7314; Pedersen, Nanna B./0000-0002-5744-939X; Pedersen, Nanna Bjerregaard/0000-0002-5744-939X; Westergaard-Nielsen, Andreas/0000-0003-1021-0530; Treier, Urs/0000-0003-4027-739X; Elberling, Bo/0000-0002-6023-885X; Karami, Mojtaba/0000-0002-5996-853X",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,JAN,2020,47,1,,,,,87,100,,10.1111/jbi.13644,,JUN 2019,,,,,WOS:000473986600001,,,,,09/09/2020,52,empirical,shrub growth,growth,"Nuuk fjord, GL",64.5,-51.23,dendrochronology,herbivory,biotic,,1,species,,WOS search

The present paper focuses on one of the world's terrestrial biomes, the arctic tundra, which is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. A severe threat to tundra is global warming, which causes permafrost to melt affecting species survival, and which releases soil-bound carbon in the form of greenhouse gases. Tundra vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses and lichens - a woodland type of vegetation dominated primarily by birch shrubs. The aim of this paper is to summarize and highlight my thirty three years of genetic studies of birch woodlands in Iceland, from the discovery of introgressive hybridization in birch and estimating the extent of introgression, to uncovering past hybridization events since the end of the last glaciation about 9000 years ago. The studies use different approaches, from cytogenetic and botanical, to molecular and palynological. The overall results show clearly that hybridization between B. nana and B. pubescens is widespread in Iceland; the resulting gene flow via introgressive hybridization is bi-directional; and that the process is continuous through time and space. Iceland could be considered a birch hybrid zone, harbouring genetic variation which may be advantageous in subarctic regions. However, waves of hybridization associated with climate warming could drive one of the species into extinction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1513-1874,,,,,JUN,2019,45,3,,,,,203,211,,10.2306/scienceasia1513-1874.2019.45.203,,,,,,,WOS:000477078400001,,,,,09/09/2020,53,review / meta-analysis,shrub genetics,hybridisation level,"Iceland, IS",,,various,,,,,species,,WOS search

However, these different influences of water on vegetation patterns have not been evaluated simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate the importance of three water aspects (spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture and fluvial disturbance) for three ecologically and evolutionary distinct taxonomical groups (vascular plants, mosses and lichens) in Fennoscandian mountain tundra. Fine-scale plant occurrence data for 271 species were collected from 378 x 1 m(2) plots sampled over broad environmental gradients (water, temperature, radiation, soil pH, cryogenic processes and the dominant allelopathic plant species). While controlling all other key environmental variables, water in its different aspects proved to be a crucial environmental driver, acting on individual species and on community characteristics. The inclusion of the water variables significantly improved our models. In this high-latitude system, the importance of spatial variability of water exceeds the importance of temperature for the fine-scale distribution of species from the three taxonomical groups. We found differing responses to the three water variables between and within the taxonomical groups. Water as a resource was the most important water-related variable in species distribution models across all taxonomical groups. Both water resource and disturbance were strongly related to vascular plant species richness, whereas for moss species richness, water resources had the highest influence. For lichen species richness, water disturbance was the most influential water-related variable. These findings demonstrate that water variables are not only independent properties of tundra hydrology, but also that water is truly a multifaceted driver of vegetation patterns at high-latitudes.",,,,"Kemppinen, J./AAD-8393-2020; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/E-7784-2011","Kemppinen, J./0000-0001-7521-7229; le Roux, Peter Christiaan/0000-0002-7941-7444; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143; Aalto, Juha/0000-0001-6819-4911; Niittynen, Pekka/0000-0002-7290-029X",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,JUN,2019,128,6,,,,,811,822,,10.1111/oik.05764,,,,,,,WOS:000472121700005,,,,,09/09/2020,54,empirical,species diversity,,"Mt Saana, FI",,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We focus on river dynamics in the context of channel-floodplain interactions and the implications for organic carbon storage in floodplains. As sites of nutrient processing and storage of sediments and organic matter, changes in channel and floodplain form and process will impact sediment yields, nutrient and organic matter export to the Arctic Ocean, aquatic and riparian habitat, and infrastructure. We present a review of the factors influencing reach-scale river dynamics, using the framework of factors affecting erosive force and erosional resistance of banks and floodplain surfaces, which will change due to a warming climate. We summarize studies indicating how observed and modeled trends in these factors will affect erosive force and erosional resistance in the future. We then hypothesize the net effects that these changes will have on the ratio of erosive force to erosional resistance, and the cascading effects on channel and floodplain form and process. We describe two scenarios that could occur under different conditions in the form of conceptual models, one in which the ratio of erosive force and erosional resistance decreases, and one in which the ratio increases. An increase in the ratio of erosive force to erosional resistance due to a reduction in permafrost extent and depth and an overall increase in discharge would increase bank erosion, bank failures, sediment supply, and lateral channel migration rates, decreasing floodplain turnover time and the age of riparian vegetation. A decrease in the ratio of erosive force to erosional resistance due to a reduction in erosive force relative to sediment supply would cause enhanced deposition within the river corridor. Regardless of which scenario may occur, changes in channel process and form will influence the ratio of lateral to vertical accretion, change the nature and stored amount of floodplain sediment, and change the sources and storage of organic carbon within floodplains.",,,,,"Lininger, Katherine/0000-0003-0378-9505",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-8252,1872-6828,,,,JUN,2019,193,,,,,,24,44,,10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.02.024,,,,,,,WOS:000470940800002,,,,,09/09/2020,55,review / meta-analysis,organic carbon stocks,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In the tundra biome, mammalian herbivores may both accelerate and decelerate plant biomass growth, microbial activity and nutrient cycling, that is, ecosystem process rates. Selective foraging and associated declines of palatable species are known to be major drivers of plant-soil feedbacks. However, declines in dominant plants of low palatability often linked with high herbivore densities may also modify ecosystem process rates, yet have received little attention. We present data from an island experiment with a 10-year vole density manipulation, to test the hypothesis that herbivores accelerate process rates by decreasing the relative abundance of poorly palatable plants to palatable ones. We measured plant species abundances and community composition, nitrogen contents of green plant tissues and multiple soil and litter variables under high and low vole density. Corroborating our hypothesis, periodic high vole density increased ecosystem process rates in low-productive tundra. High vole density was associated with both increasing relative abundance of palatable forbs over unpalatable evergreen dwarf shrubs and higher plant N content both at species and at community level. Changes in plant community composition, in turn, explained variation in microbial activity in litter and soil inorganic nutrient availability. We propose a new conceptual model with two distinct vole-plant-soil feedback pathways. Voles may drive local plant-soil feedbacks that either increase or decrease ecosystem process rates, in turn promoting heterogeneity in vegetation and soils across tundra landscapes.",,,,"Brathen, Kari Anne/AAN-4666-2020","Brathen, Kari Anne/0000-0003-0942-1074; Vaisanen, Maria/0000-0001-9055-8443; Tuomisto, Hanna/0000-0003-1640-490X",,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,JUN,2019,22,4,,,,,827,843,,10.1007/s10021-018-0307-4,,,,,,,WOS:000468963200011,,,,,09/09/2020,56,empirical,community composition; nutrient dynamics,biomass; nutrient content,"Finnmark, NO",69.75,24.5,vegetation surveys; herbivore exclusion; transplants,herbivory; microtopography,biotic; abiotic,,5,community,,WOS search

Most of the work quantifying these changes has been done in small areas and over relatively recent time scales. These land-cover transitions are highly spatially variable, and we have limited understanding of the factors underlying this variation. We use repeat photography to generate a data set of land-cover changes in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, stretching back a century and spanning a range of edaphic, topographic, and climatic conditions. Most land-cover classes were quite stable, with low probabilities of transitioning to other land-cover types. The advance of woody vegetation into low-stature tundra, and the spread of conifer trees into shrub-dominated areas, were both more likely at low elevations and in areas without permafrost. Permafrost also reduced the likelihood of herbaceous vegetation transitioning to woody cover. Exceptions to the general trend of relative stability included nearly all (96%) of the broadleaf forest-dominated areas being invaded by conifers, an expected successional trajectory, and many open gravel river bars (17.8%) transitioning to thick shrubs. These floodplain areas were distinctly not at equilibrium, as only 0.1% of shrub-dominated areas converted to gravel. Warming temperatures in coming decades and concomitant declines in the extent of permafrost are predicted to enhance the spread of woody vegetation in Denali further, but only by similar to 3%.

These snow-rich treeless ecosystems are affected by delayed snowmelt, causing shorter growing seasons. Snow-tolerant plants occupy the centre of subarctic snowpatches, whereas black spruce trees grow at the margins. Snowpatches have shown sporadic expansion and shrinkage phases from tree establishment and mortality linked to climatic trends. Field surveys in the subarctic of eastern Canada are showing an afforestation process occurring in snowpatches. The origin and nature of this afforestation were investigated based on the hypothesis that tree colonization and growth were closely associated with recent changes in climate. Snowpatches were categorized into three types based on border trees: forested, semi-forested and tundra-like. In eight randomly selected snowpatches of each type, snowpatch borders and areas covered by deciduous shrubs or trees were mapped and chionophilous plants and frost-associated soil disturbances were recorded. Radial (tree-ring) and vertical growth were measured on stems to evaluate the impact of climate and local factors on snowpatch black spruce populations. Two waves of spruce colonization occurred in all forested and semi-forested snowpatches in the 1960s and in the 1980s to present. Spruce establishment was more frequent and abundant in recent years, near the forest margins and on moss and barren seedbeds. Expanding shrub (dwarf birch) cover inhibited spruce seedling establishment. Tree establishment and growth were positively correlated with growing season temperature and negatively correlated with annual maximum snow depth. More recently established spruce seedlings exhibited faster vertical growth than those established in the 20th century. Synthesis. Due to warmer conditions and earlier snowmelt in eastern Canada, black spruce trees and dwarf birch shrubs are racing through subarctic snowpatches. This afforestation could change biodiversity in the subarctic and affect watershed dynamics through a change in snowmelt pattern. Subarctic snowpatches are climate-sensitive ecosystems of the forest-tundra landscape, forming ideal biotopes for snow-tolerant, arctic-alpine species. Further tree encroachment in snowpatches in this century is potentially a threat to plant diversity, especially chionophilous species that have no corridors to migrate towards arctic ecosystems.",,,,"Jean, Melanie/AAG-2814-2019","Jean, Melanie/0000-0002-7393-5566; TRUCHON-SAVARD, Alexandre/0000-0002-9616-8902",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,MAY,2019,107,3,,,,,1154,1166,,10.1111/1365-2745.13123,,,,,,,WOS:000467417500011,,,,,09/09/2020,59,empirical,tree colonisation,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We investigated temporal trends, controls, and outcomes in floral succession on a subarctic glacial foreland. Specifically, we examined changes in community composition (mosses, low shrubs, forbs, trees, and graminoids) over long-term (decadal) and short-term (<10years) scales and attempted to identify the underlying processes responsible for the observed successional patterns.MethodsThe study area was the foreland of the Skaftafellsj0kull, located in Vatnaj0kull National Park near the south coast of Iceland. We established nine transect lines at varying distances from the ice front representing surfaces of age ranging from less than one decade to over 100years. Each transect consisted of five measurement stations of 1m(2) where we measured vegetative cover (VC), species richness (SR), and species density (SD) and calculated species evenness (SE). Measurements were made initially in 2007 and repeated at the same geographic coordinates in 2014.ResultsVC increased with distance from the ice front from 16% to over 90%. SR and SD increased from the youngest pioneer community through a mid-successional stage corresponding to an age of over 60 but less than 100years. Increased VC but declining SR, SD, and SE characterized the oldest (over 100years) bryophyte-dominated surfaces. Species turnover, which involved forbs almost exclusively, increased moderately from early through mid-successional sites and declined on older sites. Comparison of the measurements made in 2014 to those made in 2007 demonstrates increased SR at mid-successional sites while SD remained relatively constant.ConclusionAt a small scale, colonization is controlled by local factors such as microtopography and aspect, particularly in proximity to the glacier. At the landscape level, changes in VC and community structure are controlled by time and nutrient availability. Low nutrient levels and limited site availability favor bryophyte dominance on the oldest surfaces. The greatest community-level changes observed over the 7-year interval were increases in surface cover by mosses and low shrubs, particularly in mid-successional and older sites.

Downward trends continue in sea ice thickness (and extent) and spring snow cover extent and duration, while near-surface permafrost continues to warm. Several of the climate indicators exhibit a significant statistical correlation with air temperature or precipitation, reinforcing the notion that increasing air temperatures and precipitation are drivers of major changes in various components of the Arctic system. To progress beyond a presentation of the Arctic physical climate changes, we find a correspondence between air temperature and biophysical indicators such as tundra biomass and identify numerous biophysical disruptions with cascading effects throughout the trophic levels. These include: increased delivery of organic matter and nutrients to Arctic near-coastal zones; condensed flowering and pollination plant species periods; timing mismatch between plant flowering and pollinators; increased plant vulnerability to insect disturbance; increased shrub biomass; increased ignition of wildfires; increased growing season CO2 uptake, with counterbalancing increases in shoulder season and winter CO2 emissions; increased carbon cycling, regulated by local hydrology and permafrost thaw; conversion between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; and shifting animal distribution and demographics.

These conditions can be damaging for plants at lower latitudes. When common crops are artificially maintained under continuous light (CL), photosynthetic processes maintain endogenous circadian rhythms, but it is unclear whether plants naturally acclimated to CL also maintain such rhythmicity. Alternatively, Arctic plants have to utilise the favourable conditions during the short Arctic summers. In this study, we evaluate the existence of daily cycles in pigment composition in three Arctic plants in a tundra ecosystem at 78 degrees N that display examples of different growth forms: the bryophyte Polytrichum hyperboreum, the herb Bistorta vivipara and the dwarf shrub Salix polaris. Changes in pigment composition are excellent indicators of the restructuring of the light-harvesting apparatus. Most pigment parameters analysed did not show any consistent pattern of variation between subjective noon and midnight. P. hyperboreum had the highest level of rhythmicity, while S. polaris was the most stable. Despite these subtle changes, the primary effects observed were induced by light and its effect on the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments (AZ/VAZ). Both short- and long-term adjustments of the AZ/VAZ correlated with changes in photochemical efficiency (phi(PSII)). When the plants were artificially darkened during the night, it became evident that the midnight sun prevents the complete relaxation of the xanthophyll cycle.

Its long-term impact is analysed in dwarf-shrubs, such as a widely distributed and pioneering species Salix polaris (polar willow). Understanding the functioning of lateral meristems in these dwarf-shrubs is however limited, affecting interpretation of the data. The presented study focused on the formation and anatomy of the derived secondary tissues in the stems of S. polaris from polar habitats. The entire branches of the polar willow were collected in five vegetation types of tundra located in SW Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and analysed on the series of transverse and longitudinal sections. Our analyses showed that the periderm developed in two or three-year old stems as the secondary protective tissue, and that the multiple epidermis, typical of many willow species, was not formed in S. polaris. The secondary xylem in the polar willow stems showed considerable differences in diameter and length of vessel elements within a single stem. Importantly, the size of the vessel elements differed also depending on the tundra vegetation type. Our findings suggest that the soil moisture was a main factor determining the size of vessels, and that their size was not correlated to the nitrogen supply.

During the growing season, the observed fluxes exhibited a great deal of temporal variability, which was largely the result of the pronounced spatial variability of soil and vegetation characteristics within the footprint. Explaining this variability was based on three data-driven modelling approaches: the automatically operating algorithms stepwise regression as well as neural network, and a mechanistic model, which utilised exponential relationships between the methane flux and both flux drivers soil temperature and friction velocity. A substantial improvement in model performance was achieved by applying footprint information in the form of relative contributions of three vegetation classes to the flux signal. This aspect indicates that the vegetation served as an integrated proxy for flux drivers, whose characteristics permanently varied according to the shifting source area. The neural network performed best in explaining the variability of the observed methane fluxes. However, validating the models' generalisability revealed that the mechanistic model provided the most predictive power suggesting that this model best captured the causality between the methane flux and its drivers. After integrating the gap-filled time series, all models yielded footprint budgets that were similar in magnitude. These budgets, however, lacked representativity due to the sensor location bias, i.e. their strong dependence on tower location, measurement height and wind field conditions. Thus, an unbiased budget of the total area of the flood plain was estimated utilising the mechanistic model. Initially, a downscaling procedure partitioned the observed flux with a seasonal mean of 0.012 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) into three individual vegetation class fluxes accounting for shrubs (0.0004 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), sedges (0.052 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and intermediate vegetation (0.018 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). These decomposed fluxes in turn formed the basis - in conjunction with a classified high-resolution orthomosaic of the flood plain - for the vegetation class area-weighted upscaling. Alternatively, the straightforward upscaling of the footprint budgets (without the preceding downscaling) yielded budgets that underestimated the methane source strength of the flood plain by roughly 42 %. Hence, the application of fine-scale information on surface characteristics is crucial for both modelling methane flux dynamics and adequately estimating budgets of heterogeneous ecosystems being abundant in the tundra biome.",,,,"Wille, Christian/J-3657-2013; Kutzbach, Lars/L-5765-2015","Wille, Christian/0000-0003-0930-6527; Kutzbach, Lars/0000-0003-2631-2742",,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1923,1873-2240,,,,MAR 15,2019,266,,,,,,243,255,,10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.06.026,,,,,,,WOS:000458468200023,,,,,09/09/2020,64,modelling,methane fluxes,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Moreover, heavy metal concentrations in 6 species of vascular plants collected in different areas were analysed.ResultsThe soil samples varied considerably in pH - from acid to alkaline, texture - from sand to loamy sand, and C:N ratio - from very low to high. In the soils, only partial Cd elevation expressed as the geoaccumulation index (I-geo) and the enrichment factor (EF) was detected. In the plants, the most significantly elevated concentrations of heavy metals expressed as I-geo and EF as well as the biological accumulation factor, bioconcentration factor, and translocation factor were detected in Salix polaris, Dryas octopetala, and Draba corymbosa. The high number of bacteria corresponded with an increase in the ecophysiological diversity index and the low colony development index, whereas a reverse relationship was found for fungi.ConclusionsThere was no significant impact of the geochemical properties on the total content of heavy metals in soil. The similar position of Cd and Pb in the order of heavy metal accumulation in the soil and plants was confirmed. TF showed that mainly these two metals were transported efficiently from roots to shoots. In the plants, the metals were distributed depending on the life form and their higher levels were detected in the woody perennials, e.g. S. polaris, D. octopetala, D. corymbosa, than in the herbaceous perennials. Very high numbers of culturable microorganisms were determined, regardless of the soil properties and plant species, which indicated that they were involved in the transformation of compounds containing C, N, and P and in the availability of heavy metals.

Although most studies of dryland biocrusts have been conducted in warm deserts, dryland biocrusts also exist in the Arctic, where they may be an important source of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) to nutrient-limited environments. In Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, wind-driven soil erosion has created a heterogeneous landscape where biocrusts dominate distinct patches of soil but are absent from the surrounding shrub and graminoid tundra. Prior to this study, little was known about the physical development and nutrient cycling of west Greenland biocrusts and their role in maintaining landscape heterogeneity. We characterized the physical properties, lichen assemblages, and nutrient concentrations of biocrusts and underlying soils along gradients in biocrust development and age. We found that biocrusts took 180 +/- 40years to fully develop and that biocrusts became thicker and soil penetration resistance increased as they developed. The N-fixing lichen Stereocaulon sp. was found throughout the study region at all stages of biocrust development. Natural N-15 abundance suggests that Stereocaulon sp. obtains about half of its N from biological fixation and that some biologically fixed N is incorporated into the underlying soils over time. Although the N and C concentrations of underlying soils increased slightly with biocrust development, nutrient concentrations under the most developed biocrusts remained low compared to the surrounding vegetated tundra.

Despite the vulnerability of Arctic and boreal landscapes to change, little has been done to characterize landscape change and associated drivers across northern high-latitude ecosystems. Here we characterize the historical sensitivity of Alaska's ecosystems to environmental change and anthropogenic disturbances using expert knowledge, remote sensing data, and spatiotemporal analyses and modeling. Time-series analysis of moderate-and high-resolution imagery was used to characterize land- and water-surface dynamics across Alaska. Some 430,000 interpretations of ecological and geomorphological change were made using historical air photos and satellite imagery, and corroborate land-surface greening, browning, and wetness/moisture trend parameters derived from peak-growing season Landsat imagery acquired from 1984 to 2015. The time series of change metrics, together with climatic data and maps of landscape characteristics, were incorporated into a modeling framework for mapping and understanding of drivers of change throughout Alaska. According to our analysis, approximately 13% (similar to 174,000 +/- 8700 km(2)) of Alaska has experienced directional change in the last 32 years (+/- 95% confidence intervals). At the ecoregions level, substantial increases in remotely sensed vegetation productivity were most pronounced in western and northern foothills of Alaska, which is explained by vegetation growth associated with increasing air temperatures. Significant browning trends were largely the result of recent wildfires in interior Alaska, but browning trends are also driven by increases in evaporative demand and surface-water gains that have predominately occurred over warming permafrost landscapes. Increased rates of photosynthetic activity are associated with stabilization and recovery processes following wildfire, timber harvesting, insect damage, thermokarst, glacial retreat, and lake infilling and drainage events.

Because microbial processes are extremely sensitive to change in temperature below freezing, overwinter warming strongly stimulates decomposition and nutrient mineralization and ultimately promotes the conversion of sedge-dominated tussock tundra into shrub tundra. We characterized the responses of decomposition in shrub tundra and tussock tundra soils to changes in the rate and extent of freezing using laboratory simulations to study a range of active layer freeze-up scenarios that included variation in time held above 0 degrees C (an acclimation period) and final temperature (-2 degrees C to -20 degrees C). We hypothesized that shrub soil decomposers would be more sensitive to the rate of the freezing process than tussock soil decomposers, but less sensitive to the extent of freezing. Although freezing strongly influenced microbial processes, the effects of freezing tended to not significantly vary across the range freezing regimes tested. Unexpectedly, the tussock-derived soil decomposer community was more sensitive than shrub-derived soil to the freezing treatments. Freezing conditions stimulated tussock soil to release more water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) that was composed of a greater proportion of microbially derived materials than shrub soil under the same conditions. Freezing-driven changes in the tussock WEOC pool coincided with reduced microbial decomposer biomass, while the shrub decomposer biomass was relatively insensitive to the freezing treatments. These findings suggest that the microbial community of shrub-dominated soils is more resistant to the soil freezing process than the tussock-dominated decomposer community and increases available soil N while reducing labile C release as the soils freeze. Because autumn nutrient dynamics set the stage for overwinter tundra biogeochemical conditions, increasing shrub dominance in tussock tundra may therefore promote both plant N availability and decomposer C limitation during thaw.",,,,"Schimel, Joshua/AAE-7380-2019","Schimel, Joshua/0000-0002-1022-6623; Schaeffer, Sean/0000-0002-9684-2952",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,FEB,2019,10,2,,,,,,,e02608,10.1002/ecs2.2608,,,,,,,WOS:000461577000028,,,,,09/09/2020,68,empirical,decomposition dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

This study investigates the impact of climate change, as represented by simulations using a high-resolution atmospheric model under a pseudo-global-warming configuration, and projected changes in vegetation, using a spatially distributed and physically based Arctic hydrological model, on a small headwater basin at the tundra-taiga transition in northwestern Canada. Climate projections under the RCP8.5 emission scenario show a 6.1 degrees C warming, a 38% increase in annual precipitation, and a 19 W m(-2) increase in all-wave annual irradiance over the twenty-first century. Hydrological modeling results suggest a shift in hydrological processes with maximum peak snow accumulation increasing by 70%, snow-cover duration shortening by 26 days, active layer deepening by 0.25 m, evapotranspiration increasing by 18%, and sublimation decreasing by 9%. This results in an intensification of the hydrological regime by doubling discharge volume, a 130% increase in spring runoff, and earlier and larger peak streamflow. Most hydrological changes were found to be driven by climate change; however, increasing vegetation cover and density reduced blowing snow redistribution and sublimation, and increased evaporation from intercepted rainfall.

These events can cause landscape-scale vegetation damage and so are likely to have major impacts on ecosystem CO2 balance. However, there is little understanding of the impacts on CO2 fluxes, especially across the growing season. Furthermore, while widespread shoot mortality is commonly observed with browning events, recent observations show that shoot stress responses are also common, and manifest as high levels of persistent anthocyanin pigmentation. Whether or how this response impacts ecosystem CO2 fluxes is not known. To address these research needs, a growing season assessment of browning impacts following frost drought and extreme winter warming (both extreme climatic events) on the key ecosystem CO2 fluxes Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and soil respiration (R-soil) was carried out in widespread sub-Arctic dwarf shrub heathland, incorporating both mortality and stress responses. Browning (mortality and stress responses combined) caused considerable site-level reductions in GPP and NEE (of up to 44%), with greatest impacts occurring at early and late season. Furthermore, impacts on CO2 fluxes associated with stress often equalled or exceeded those resulting from vegetation mortality. This demonstrates that extreme events can have major impacts on ecosystem CO2 balance, considerably reducing the carbon sink capacity of the ecosystem, even where vegetation is not killed. Structural Equation Modelling and additional measurements, including decomposition rates and leaf respiration, provided further insight into mechanisms underlying impacts of mortality and stress on CO2 fluxes.

Compared with paired random locations, nests were more likely to be in woody vegetation located closer to water at the territory scale and had less lateral vegetative cover but taller vegetation nearer to the nest site. Geese did not select nesting locations in vegetation that provided maximum cover, but rather located nests in areas providing both concealment from predators and visibility for the nesting female to enable early predator detection. Assessing the effect of habitat attributes on nest success did not yield unambiguous results, with the most parsimonious model showing an increasing probability of nest success with increasing nest age alone.

In both cases, the research results are species essays with a brief description of the spatial heterogeneity of quantitative indicators to the placement of animals on the accepted level of data aggregation. The influence of environmental gradients on the distribution of species or groups is usually assessed by given natural and anthropogenic factors; their composition is not formalized and varies depending on the objectives of a particular study. All of the above makes it difficult to generalize the results of studies of the species distribution in different areas, as well as the comparison of data on the spatial variability of biotopic preferences and its causes for different species in the same territory. The main tasks of our research were to compare biotopic preferences, abundance and number across all species of small mammals and to develop a general classification reflecting similarities and differences in their distribution across Western Siberia as a whole. The study is not ecological, but zoogeographic, so the terms should be uniform, at least in seasonal terms. The main zoogeographic meaning of the work is to identify the general patterns of distribution of the studied species and environmental factors that correlate with the spatial heterogeneity of their abundance. Therefore, the preliminary division of the territory into habitats, as well as key sites and time of observations should be uniform. The collected and analyzed information can be used for environmental purposes, in assessing the territorial variability of prey resources for hunting birds and commercially sold fur-bearing mammals, the number of which depends significantly on the level of abundance of small mammals. The aim of this research was to analyze the distribution of Siberian brown lemming in Western Siberia and to assess the impact of the identified environmental factors on its abundance heterogeneity using population methods and approaches. The methods and approaches implemented to study the animal population were successfully used to analyze the distribution of individual species of small mammals. It allows to secure within the limits of strict separation of habitats according to similarities in the abundance and avoid their subjective dividing into groups. The distribution of the Siberian brown lemming was analyzed by the results of small mammal surveys carried out in the second half of the summer from 1954 to 2016 in the plains and mountains of Western Siberia. The abundance indices for all years were averaged by groups of vegetation maps within the zones, subzones and subzonal belts of the plain and mountain provinces. The spatial-typological organization of the biotope distribution was revealed by means of factor classification, one of the methods of cluster analysis. As a measure of similarity, the Jaccard-Naumov coefficient for quantitative characteristics was chosen. To evaluate the relationship of habitat classification, we used the linear quality approximation of the coupling matrix. The total number of Siberian lemming was obtained by converting the relative abundance indicators into absolute ones taking into account the areas of natural zones, subzones and subzonal belts. The relative error and asymmetric confidence intervals of the generalized population estimate are calculated with a confidence probability of 0.9. Siberian brown lemming within the West Siberian plain is widespread to the North of the typical Northern taiga (See Fig. 1). It was not encountered in the Altai and Kuznetsk-Salair mountain regions, although literary sources note its presence in the mountain tundra of the Northern Urals. In structured classification, five types of habitats are identified according to their degree of favorability for the Siberian brown lemming: optimal, suboptimal, subpessimal, pessimal and extreme (See Fig. 2). Most of its abundance is in the tundra and lowland meadow-willow-moss communities in the Northern moss tundra subzone belt (See Fig. 3A). Slightly less favorable are habitats of Arctic tundras. The next type includes swamps to the North of the Middle taiga and non-forest biotopes from low-shrub subarctic tundras to the Northern taiga light forests. The environmental conditions in pre-tundra open woodlands and the Northern taiga light forests are severe for the Siberian lemming. The last, extreme, type of favorability combines areas of the plain to the South of the Northern taiga light forests and mountain areas, where this lemming does not enter. Using the cluster analysis, the list of environmental factors is revealed: heat availability (the mode of zoning and subzoning on the plain, altitudinal zonation and provinciality in the mountains), zoning and subzoning on the plain separately, macro relief of areas (plain-mountains), type of vegetation, forest cover degree, swampiness, pouring in the flood and human development degree. The greatest connection with the heterogeneity of the abundance of Siberian brown lemming is traced for heat availability and zoning and subzoning (See Table 1). The other factors are less significant, their local influence is undoubted, but small, in general, for the studied area. Multiple evaluation of the relationship with all identified environmental factors and their combinations gives 78% of the recorded variance (multiple correlation coefficient 0.88). In total, the number of Siberian brown lemming in Western Siberia is estimated as 374 million individuals, almost 90% is concentrated in the Northern subarctic tundra of the plain (See Fig. 3B, Table 2). The total number of species depends on the areas of habitats of different favorability by zones, subzones and subzonal belts. Spatial variability of relative abundance (individuals per 100 cylinder-days) and total number (million individuals) is diamond-shaped. These values are declining from the Northern moss subarctic tundras to the North, in Arctic tundras, and to the South from low-shrub subarctic tundras to the Northern taiga light forests.",,,,"!B0@8:>2, ;048<8@/AAR-2611-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,1998-8591,2311-2077,,,,,2019,,46,,,,,115,134,,10.17223/19988591/46/6,,,,,,,WOS:000486963500006,,,,,09/09/2020,74,empirical,rodent distribution,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We develop a hypothesized framework based on a priori model selection of variation in daytime growing season gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) and above-and belowground respiration. The fluxes were standardized to light and temperature. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis was primarily related to soil moisture and secondarily to plant functional traits and aboveground biomass, and belowground respiration was dependent on the community weighted mean of specific leaf area (SLA(CWM)). Similarly, microbial activity was linked with SLA(CWM) and was highest in meadows, and carbon-degrading microbial activity decreased with vegetation woodiness.

Therefore, an update is important regarding how these species react to and interact with different climatic factors, and on how the predicted climatic changes will affect their distribution, growth and content of compounds affecting health. OBJECTIVE: To systemize knowledge of the Ericaceae and Empetraceae wild berry species. METHODS: A review of literature covering the above topics. CONCLUSION: This review includes five wild berry species and their subspecies: Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium uliginosum, Vaccinium oxycoccos with ssp. microcarpon, and Empetrum nigrum with ssp. nigrum, hermaphroditum and japonicum. They have been and still are collected in the wild, by local households and industry. The berries have high content of biological compounds of interest for human health. Despite the increasing interest in and demand for these wild berries, domestication attempts have been rare. The species often grow together and are competitors. Which species dominate depends on soil conditions and is determined by small differences. The changing climate and various disturbances will also influence the distribution patterns of wild berries and competing plant species. Semi-cultivation in the natural habitat is probably the best solution for viable and sustainable commercial exploitation of these resources, at least if they are sold with the label wild berries. However, these species are easily propagated by fresh cuttings, and they can grow on arable land, adapting soil conditions to fit their growing preferences. Such cultivation, to our knowledge has not yet been performed on a large economic scale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1878-5093,1878-5123,,,,,2019,9,3,,,,,515,547,,10.3233/JBR-190390,,,,,,,WOS:000484120900011,,,,,09/09/2020,76,review,berry characteristics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Long time series of primary production are rarely available, restricting our mechanistic understanding of vegetation and ecosystem dynamics under climate change. Dendrochronological tools are increasingly used instead, particularly in the Arcticthe world's most rapidly warming biome. Yet, high-latitude plant species are subject to strong energy allocation trade-offs, and whether annual allocations to secondary growth (e.g. tree-rings) actually reflect primary production above-ground remains unknown. Taking advantage of a unique ground-based monitoring time series of annual vascular plant biomass in high Arctic Svalbard (78 degrees N), we evaluated how well retrospective ring growth of the widespread dwarf shrub Salix polaris represents above-ground biomass production of vascular plants. 2. Using a balanced design in permanent plots for plant biomass monitoring, we collected 30 S. polaris shrubs across five sites in each of two habitats. We established annual ring growth time series using linear mixed-effects models and related them to weather records and 13 years of above-ground biomass production in six habitats. 3. Annual ring growth was positively correlated with above-ground biomass production of both S. polaris (r = 0.56) and the vascular plant community as a whole (r = 0.70). As for above-ground biomass, summer temperature was the main driver of ring growth, with this ecological signal becoming particularly clear when accounting for plant, site and habitat heterogeneity. The results suggest that ring growth measurements performed on this abundant shrub can be used to track fluctuations in past vascular plant production of high arctic tundra. 4. Synthesis. Dendrochronological tools are increasingly used on arctic shrubs to enhance our understanding of vegetation dynamics in the world's most rapidly warming biome. Fundamental to such applications is the assumption that annual differences in ring growth reflect between-year variation in above-ground biomass production. We showed that ring growth indeed was a robust proxy for the annual above-ground productivity of both the focal shrub and the vascular plant community as a whole. Despite the challenges of constructing ring growth chronologies from irregularly growing arctic shrubs, our findings confirm that shrub dendrochronology can open new opportunities for community-dynamic studies, including in remote places where annual field sampling is difficult to achieve.",,,,"Buchwal, Agata/F-5516-2013; Hansen, Brage Bremset/B-9942-2008","Buchwal, Agata/0000-0001-6879-6656; Hansen, Brage Bremset/0000-0001-8763-4361; Le Moullec, Mathilde/0000-0002-3290-7091",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,JAN,2019,107,1,,,,,436,451,,10.1111/1365-2745.13036,,,,,,,WOS:000459070600036,,,,,09/09/2020,77,empirical,shrub growth,growth,"Svalbard, NO",77.9,15.2,dendrochronology,summer temperature; microtopography,abiotic,Salix polaris,1,species,,WOS search

Warming has been linked to an expansion of woody vegetation across tundra, raising questions about how these two phenomena interact to modulate C stocks and turnover. We investigated how long-term warming and litter addition have modified microbial processes, soil characteristics, and C and nitrogen (N) stocks. We hypothesized that warming and litter would interact to amplify soil C losses and would be accompanied by increases in microbial activity. Using soil samples from a 16-year warming and litter addition field manipulation, we measured soil C and N stocks, heterotrophic respiration, extracellular enzyme activity, and microbial stoichiometry. We found that warming decreased C and N stocks across the entire soil profile. Depth-specific analyses illustrated that these changes are driven by increasing microbial activity at 5-10 and 10-15cm depth, and trends toward higher dissolved organic C and N at 5-10cm depth. This emphasizes the potential for increased leaching losses with warming and additional litter. While litter addition did not change overall C and N stocks, it appears to modify the ecosystem by adding nutrients and C to the soil.

Climate warming appears to be linked to the expansion of shrubs across tundra, but it is unclear how shrubs affect the activity of soil microbes. We investigated three potential mechanisms by which shrubs may stimulate soil microbial activity, by 1) increasing the rate of litter inputs, 2) promoting soil microbial adaptation to litter and 3) reducing nutrient limitation. We created microcosms of root-free soils collected from shrub (Alnuts fruticosa, Benda nana, and Salix pulchra) and non-shrub plots in arctic Alaska and conducted two experiments. We quantified heterotrophic soil respiration rates in response to litter inputs (experiment 1), or nutrient inputs (nitrogen, phosphorus, or both nutrients together, experiment 2). We found that shrub-conditioned soils maintained higher rates of soil respiration in both experiments. Shrub litter increased respiration in both soil types, but the relative response was greater in non-shrub soils. We found no evidence that shrubs reduce nutrient limitation to heterotrophic respiration, although we observed a short-term increase in respiration after phosphorus addition in both soil types.

These studies are particularly valuable in the high latitudes, regions especially vulnerable to rapid climate change and increasingly used for plant-based proxy reconstructions of past hydroclimate, but also where modern vegetation is understudied compared to the lower latitudes. Here we investigate delta H-2 values from leaf wax n-alkanes of vascular tundra plants in the Kangerlussuaq area of western Greenland. We collected a variety of common tundra species to study possible interspecies variability in delta H-2 values including dwarf shrubs (Betula nana, Empetrum hermaphroditum, Salix glauca), forbs and graminoids (Vaccinium uliginosum, Rhododendron tomentosum, and Calamagrostis lapponica), a horsetail species (Equisetum arvense), and a submerged aquatic macrophyte from a local lake (Stuckenia filiformis). Using previously measured leaf and stem waters to help constrain potential drivers of leaf wax n-alkane delta H-2 values, we find that the overall net fractionation (epsilon(app)) from the studied species is -75 +/- 20%. The eapp at Kangerlussuaq is consistent with other studies of Arctic vegetation that find smaller eapp than from the majority of lower latitude sites. The fractionation of leaf water and xylem water (epsilon(lw/xw)) and the fractionation of xylem water and precipitation (epsilon(xw/p)) are both relatively constant, suggesting stable leaf and soil related fractionations across species. Estimates of biosynthetic fractionation (epsilon(bio)), as evidenced from the fractionation of the delta H-2 values of n-alkanes and leaf water (epsilon(wax/ lw)), are not constant across species as sometimes assumed, and are small (average of ebio is -120 +/- 27%) compared to many published estimates. This supports a significant role in ebio shaping the eapp in this high latitude setting, where lipid biosynthesis may be driving differences in n-alkane delta H-2 values. This finding suggests that lipids in the Kangerlussuaq plants studied rely on the use of some proportion of different hydrogen sources during lipid synthesis, such as stored NADPH. The cumulative results of this survey of Kangerlussuaq area n-alkane delta H-2 values and water-wax fractionations suggest that fractionation in the high latitudes during the short summer growing season may play an important role in governing the small eapp compared to many low latitude sites. Better understanding of appropriate eapp and the importance of ebio in controlling plant wax fractionation from the high latitudes is necessary for future reconstructions of hydroclimate using leaf wax delta H-2 values in these regions.

Increasing temperatures and altered hydrology are driving shifts in ecosystem biophysical properties that, observed by satellites, manifest as long-term changes in regional NDVI. In an effort to examine the underlying ecological drivers of these changes, we used field-scale remote sensing of NDVI to track peatland vegetation in experiments that manipulated hydrology, temperature, and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. In addition to NDVI, we measured percent cover by species and leaf area index (LAI). We monitored two peatland types broadly representative of the boreal region. One site was a rich fen located near Fairbanks, Alaska, at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX), and the second site was a nutrient-poor bog located in Northern Minnesota within the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. We found that NDVI decreased with long-term reductions in soil moisture at the APEX site, coincident with a decrease in photosynthetic leaf area and the relative abundance of sedges. We observed increasing NDVI with elevated temperature at the SPRUCE site, associated with an increase in the relative abundance of shrubs and a decrease in forb cover. Warming treatments at the SPRUCE site also led to increases in the LAI of the shrub layer. We found no strong effects of elevated CO2 on community composition.

However, climate change models developed to predict species distributions do not always incorporate interactions between them. The northerly shift of the boreal forest and associated dwarf shrub communities will be directly affected by warming. But warming will also indirectly affect plant communities via impacts on the intensity and frequency of associated insect outbreaks. We present a general model exploring plant host herbivory in response to the balance between insect crowding, host consumption and climate. We examined how these factors dictate the feeding preference of Epirrita autumnata larvae during an outbreak on dwarf shrub vegetation in Sub-arctic Fennoscandia. Data were collected from an outdoor experiment investigating future climate change scenarios (elevated CO2 and temperature) on the dwarf shrub community that included deciduous (Vaccinium myrtillus) and evergreen species (V. vitis-idaea and Empetrum nigrum). We observed that larval crowding was independent of treatment under outbreak conditions. We also tested and confirmed model predictions that larvae would prefer monospecific stands of either deciduous shrubs or its evergreen competitors. For current climate conditions, larvae had a preference to consume more deciduous shrubs in mixed stands. However, at elevated temperature bilberry consumption and herbivore pressure was lower, particularly in mixed stands. Our results show that during future warming, E. autumnata herbivory could promote the success of thermophile deciduous species and possible northward migration.

We here discuss how this species-poor herbivore guild influences tundra ecosystems, especially in relation to the rapidly changing climate. We show that present herbivore assemblages have large effects on tundra ecosystem composition and function and suggest that the effect on thermophilic species expected to invade the tundra in a warmer climate is especially strong, and that herbivores slow ecosystem responses to climate change. We focus on the ability of herbivores to drive transitions between different vegetation states. One such transition is between tundra and forest. A second vegetation transition discussed is between grasslands and moss-and shrub-dominated tundra. Contemporary studies show that herbivores can drive such state shifts and that a more diverse herbivore assemblage would have even higher potential to do so. We conclude that even though many large herbivores, and especially the megaherbivores, are extinct, there is a potential to reintroduce large herbivores in many arctic locations, and that doing so would potentially reduce some of the unwanted effects of a warmer climate.

Large herbivores, wild and domestic, can cause profound changes in the structure and functioning of plant communities and therefore probably influence historical contingency; however, little empirical data on the stability of such shifts or subsequent drivers of stability are available. We studied the centennial legacy of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) pressure on arctic tundra vegetation by considering historical milking grounds (HMGs): graminoid- and forb-dominated patches amid shrub-dominated tundra, formed by historical Sami reindeer herding practices that ended approximately 100years ago. Our results show that the core areas of all studied HMGs remained strikingly stable, being hardly invaded by surrounding shrubs. Soil nitrogen concentrations were comparable to heavily grazed areas. However, the HMGs are slowly being reinvaded by vegetative growth of shrubs at the edges, and the rate of ingrowth increased with higher mineral N availability. Furthermore, our data indicate that several biotic feedbacks contribute to the stability of the HMGs: increased nutrient turnover supporting herbaceous vegetation, strong interspecific competition preventing invasion and herbivore damage to invading shrubs. In particular, voles and lemmings appear to be important, selectively damaging shrubs in the HMGs. We concluded that HMGs provide clear evidence for historical contingency of herbivore effects in arctic ecosystems.

Net fractionation of H isotopes between plant source water and n-alkyl lipids (epsilon(wax/water)) is the largest uncertainty for interpreting this proxy and depends on plant type and environment. Although popular proxies, n-alkanoic acids (n-acids) are less frequently calibrated in modern environments than n-alkanes. We constrain the net fractionation (epsilon(wax/MAP) - (Mean Annual Precipitation)) for the northern boreal forest based on n-C-24,C-26,C-28 acids in topsoils from a 13-site network in Yukon, Alaska and Northwest Territories (60-68 degrees N). n-Acid homologue distributions for common boreal plants (gymnosperm trees, shrubs, forbs, C3 grasses and mosses) show that soil n-acids are dominated by mosses, but with a reduced carbon preference index compared to fresh mosses, possibly owing to post-depositional degradation. Regionally averaged ewax/MAP values are -93 +/- 10 parts per thousand, 101 +/- 11 parts per thousand and 95 +/- 11 parts per thousand for n- C-24,C-26,C-28 acids, respectively, which are similar to values reported from low and high latitude regions.

Since latitude is typically known for ancient deposits, we parsed the dataset to obtain latitude-specific ewax/MAP values for 60-64 degrees N (-107 +/- 8 parts per thousand for n-C-26; and -101 +/- 8 parts per thousand for n-C-28) and 65-68 degrees N (-94 +/- 11 parts per thousand for n-C-26; and -89 +/- 10 parts per thousand for n-C-28). These soil-derived values are relevant for hydroclimate reconstructions using fossil n-acids in paleosols from a comparable paleoflora and latitude. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

For plants, range shifts can only occur via successful recruitment beyond their current distribution limit. However, many environmental and ecological filters can act upon recruitment and establishment, thereby potentially limiting the expected climate-driven shifts. In this study, we investigate potential mechanical and chemical constraints that vegetation above the tall shrubline in alpine and Arctic tundra could impose upon the successful establishment of willow species in the Canadian Western Arctic. We collected willow seeds from an alpine and an Arctic shrubline and conducted germination trials to test (1) for seedbed preferences among three natural and one experimentally scarified seedbeds, and (2) for vulnerability to allelopathic chemicals produced by ericaceous dwarf shrub species. We found that germination was almost four times higher on manually exposed bare ground than on intact, herbaceous vegetation. Seeds of two willow species, Salix arctica and Salix pulchra, were not affected by leaf extracts from dwarf shrubs, Cassiope tetragona and Vaccinum uliginosum, but the germination of Salix richardsonii was reduced by as much as 24% in the presence of chemicals from C. tetragona. Our results suggest that biotic interactions could limit the predicted expansion of tall shrubs in the tundra by interfering with germination. Seemingly species-specific responses highlight the need for replicated studies across a wider range of species combinations. Potential range shifts may not occur as a uniform translocation of the shrubline, but could change the composition of the plant community by filtering out certain species.",,,,"Myers-Smith, Isla H/D-1529-2013","Myers-Smith, Isla H/0000-0002-8417-6112; Angers-Blondin, Sandra/0000-0001-8907-3502",,,,,,,,,,,,0722-4060,1432-2056,,,,NOV,2018,41,11,,,,,2211,2219,,10.1007/s00300-018-2355-9,,,,,,,WOS:000446075800004,,,,,09/09/2020,87,empirical,willow germination,seedling germination,"Qikiqtaruk, CA",69.568,-138.918,seedling counts,seedbed type; allelopathic compound,biotic,Salix arctica; Salix pulchra,3,species,,WOS search

A better understanding of how environmental factors shape plant structure and function is crucial for predicting the consequences of environmental change for ecosystem functioning. Here we explore the biome-wide relationships between temperature, moisture and seven key plant functional traits both across space and over three decades of warming at 117 tundra locations. Spatial temperature-trait relationships were generally strong but soil moisture had a marked influence on the strength and direction of these relationships, highlighting the potentially important influence of changes in water availability on future trait shifts in tundra plant communities. Community height increased with warming across all sites over the past three decades, but other traits lagged far behind predicted rates of change. Our findings highlight the challenge of using space-for-time substitution to predict the functional consequences of future warming and suggest that functions that are tied closely to plant height will experience the most rapid change. They also reveal the strength with which environmental factors shape biotic communities at the coldest extremes of the planet and will help to improve projections of functional changes in tundra ecosystems with climate warming.",,,,"Wipf, Sonja/A-5075-2010; Carbognani, Michele/H-6644-2019; Forbes, Bruce C./L-4431-2013; Ruger, Nadja/J-6393-2015; Craine, Joseph/D-4569-2009; Manning, Peter/I-6523-2012; Olofsson, Johan/A-9362-2009; Niinemets, Ulo/A-3816-2008; Normand, Signe/A-1561-2012; Weijers, Stef/T-8944-2019; Wilmking, Martin/AAV-9310-2020; Ninot, Josep M/H-3592-2015; Treier, Urs/A-1913-2012; Grau, Oriol/Y-7075-2019; Milbau, Ann/AAF-3022-2020; Thomas, Haydn J.D./H-8059-2019; Ozinga, Wim A./F-1640-2011; Bahn, Michael/I-3536-2013; Anadon-Rosell, Alba/AAA-5464-2020; Onipchenko, Vladimir G./V-4244-2018; Cerabolini, Bruno Enrico Leone/L-7354-2019; Hik, David S/B-3462-2009; Myers-Smith, Isla H/D-1529-2013; Goetz, Scott J/A-3393-2015; Buras, Allan/B-1412-2012; de Vries, Franciska T/D-3041-2009; Ruger, Nadja/Q-6418-2019; Jaroszynska, Francesca/AAQ-7725-2020; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/AAO-4307-2020; Wookey, Philip/AAA-6271-2020; Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/C-6058-2008; Poorter, Hendrik/B-8062-2010; Nabe-Nielsen, Jacob/A-3992-2014; Diaz, Sandra/Q-9804-2018; Harper, Karen/R-4735-2019; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Dainese, Matteo/M-1472-2017; Cornwell, William/I-4083-2019; Rumpf, Sabine/AAF-8795-2019; Soudzilovskaia, Nadejda A./N-4140-2015; Schaepman-Strub, Gabriela/D-8785-2011; Alatalo, Juha/C-1269-2018; Bjork, Robert G./I-9772-2019; Poorter, Hendrik/Y-2542-2019; Buchwal, Agata/F-5516-2013; Hulber, Karl/H-7822-2019; Little, Chelsea J./H-8676-2019; Blach-Overgaard, Anne/N-3105-2014; Enquist, Brian J./B-6436-2008; Poschlod, Peter/AAF-7902-2019; Johnstone, Jill/C-9204-2009; Michelsen, Anders/L-5279-2014; van Bodegom, Peter/N-8150-2015; Petraglia, Alessandro/G-3474-2017; Bjorkman, Anne/H-2211-2016; Elberling, Bo/M-4000-2014","Wipf, Sonja/0000-0002-3492-1399; Carbognani, Michele/0000-0001-7701-9859; Forbes, Bruce C./0000-0002-4593-5083; Ruger, Nadja/0000-0003-2371-4172; Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244; Manning, Peter/0000-0002-7940-2023; Niinemets, Ulo/0000-0002-3078-2192; Normand, Signe/0000-0002-8782-4154; Weijers, Stef/0000-0003-3386-5417; Wilmking, Martin/0000-0003-4964-2402; Treier, Urs/0000-0003-4027-739X; Grau, Oriol/0000-0002-3816-9499; Thomas, Haydn J.D./0000-0001-9099-6304; Ozinga, Wim A./0000-0002-6369-7859; Bahn, Michael/0000-0001-7482-9776; Anadon-Rosell, Alba/0000-0002-9447-7795; Onipchenko, Vladimir G./0000-0002-1626-1171; Cerabolini, Bruno Enrico Leone/0000-0002-3793-0733; Hik, David S/0000-0002-8994-9305; Myers-Smith, Isla H/0000-0002-8417-6112; Goetz, Scott J/0000-0002-6326-4308; de Vries, Franciska T/0000-0002-6822-8883; Ruger, Nadja/0000-0003-2371-4172; Jaroszynska, Francesca/0000-0002-2399-4146; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/0000-0003-1808-0048; Wookey, Philip/0000-0001-5957-6424; Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/0000-0001-9525-4633; Poorter, Hendrik/0000-0001-9900-2433; Nabe-Nielsen, Jacob/0000-0002-0716-9525; Dainese, Matteo/0000-0001-7052-5572; Rumpf, Sabine/0000-0001-5909-9568; Schaepman-Strub, Gabriela/0000-0002-4069-1884; Alatalo, Juha/0000-0001-5084-850X; Bjork, Robert G./0000-0001-7346-666X; Buchwal, Agata/0000-0001-6879-6656; Hulber, Karl/0000-0001-9274-1647; Little, Chelsea J./0000-0003-2803-7465; Blach-Overgaard, Anne/0000-0002-0200-1547; Enquist, Brian J./0000-0002-6124-7096; Johnstone, Jill/0000-0001-6131-9339; ELMENDORF, SARAH/0000-0003-1085-8521; Semenchuk, Philipp Robert/0000-0002-1949-6427; Michelsen, Anders/0000-0002-9541-8658; van Bodegom, Peter/0000-0003-0771-4500; Ordonez Barragan, Jenny Cristina/0000-0003-0558-7229; Hollister, Robert/0000-0002-4764-7691; Venn, Susanna/0000-0002-7433-0120; Campetella, Giandiego/0000-0001-6126-522X; Buras, Allan/0000-0003-2179-0681; Milbau, Ann/0000-0003-3555-8883; Petraglia, Alessandro/0000-0003-4632-2251; Bjorkman, Anne/0000-0003-2174-7800; Elberling, Bo/0000-0002-6023-885X; Harper, Karen/0000-0001-5390-0262; Jonsdottir, Ingibjorg Svala/0000-0003-3804-7077; Ninot, Josep M./0000-0002-3712-0810",,,,,,,,,,,,0028-0836,1476-4687,,,,OCT 4,2018,562,7725,,,,,57,+,,10.1038/s41586-018-0563-7,,,,,,,WOS:000446187900037,30258229,,,,09/09/2020,88,empirical / meta-analysis,plant functional traits,,circumpolar,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

The biochemistry of the litter being produced, the environment in which the decomposition is taking place, and the community composition and metabolism of the decomposer organisms exert a combined influence over decomposition rates. As deciduous shrubs and trees are expanding into tundra ecosystems as a result of regional climate warming, this change in vegetation represents a change in litter input to tundra soils and a change in the environment in which litter decomposes. To test the importance of litter biochemistry and environment in determining litter mass loss, we reciprocally transplanted litter between heath (Empetrum nigrum), shrub (Betula nana), and forest (Betula pubescens) at a sub-Arctic treeline in Sweden. As expansion of shrubs and trees promotes deeper snow, we also used a snow fence experiment in a tundra heath environment to understand the importance of snow depth, relative to other factors, in the decomposition of litter. Our results show that B.pubescens and B.nana leaf litter decomposed at faster rates than E.nigrum litter across all environments, while all litter species decomposed at faster rates in the forest and shrub environments than in the tundra heath. The effect of increased snow on decomposition was minimal, leading us to conclude that microbial activity over summer in the productive forest and shrub vegetation is driving increased mass loss compared to the heath. Using B.pubescens and E.nigrum litter, we demonstrate that degradation of carbohydrate-C is a significant driver of mass loss in the forest. This pathway was less prominent in the heath, which is consistent with observations that tundra soils typically have high concentrations of labile C. This experiment suggests that further expansion of shrubs and trees may stimulate the loss of undecomposed carbohydrate C in the tundra.",,,,"Wookey, Philip/AAA-6271-2020; Subke, Jens-Arne/M-3049-2013","Wookey, Philip/0000-0001-5957-6424; Subke, Jens-Arne/0000-0001-9244-639X; Blume-Werry, Gesche/0000-0003-0909-670X; Castro Diaz, Miguel/0000-0002-5304-1442; Sanderman, Jonathan/0000-0002-3215-1706",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,OCT,2018,99,10,,,,,2284,2294,,10.1002/ecy.2442,,,,,,,WOS:000446270400016,29981157,,,,09/09/2020,89,empirical,litter decomposition,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

However, most studies of shrub expansion have focused on dryland ecosystems (e.g., savannas, rangelands, grasslands), or in tundra regions (e.g., arctic, alpine). However, shrubs play a key role in other systems, such as the understory of temperate forests. In the Appalachian forests of the eastern United States, rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) is the most prevalent species constituent of the understory evergreen shrub community and can affect forest diversity and structure by altering light and moisture regimes, and changing soil chemical and physical properties. We examine the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of the evergreen shrub layer within a mid-Appalachian forest over the period from 1986 to 2011 using Landsat TM data to explore how shrub expansion is related to landscape position (e.g., elevation, aspect, and distance-to-stream). We use a combination of remotely sensed vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, tasseled cap indices) derived from snow-free, leaf-off Landsat 5 surface reflectance data from 1986 to 2011 paired with a Random Forest classification model to examine shrub dynamics in the Weimer Run watershed near Canaan Valley, West Virginia, a first-order, high-altitude watershed. We show extensive increases in winter greenness we attribute to expansion of the evergreen shrub community. From 1986 to 2011, there is a 0.14 increase in winter NDVI, with a 52% relative increase in shrub coverage over 25 yr. Shrub expansion is most notable at lower elevations, along streams, and on southerly oriented slopes. We argue that changes in shrub abundance are due to decreased moisture limitations driven by changing climate. There is an increased effort to reintroduce native conifers to this region, but changes in the shrub community jeopardize this effort, as rhododendron inhibits the growth and dispersal of these conifers (e.g., red spruce). Our results show that rhododendron shrubs are expanding into areas of the forest from which they have previously been restricted. Use of these remote sensing methods may allow better habitat suitability mapping, leading to better targeted restoration efforts and more-informed ecosystem forecasts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,OCT,2018,9,10,,,,,,,e02404,10.1002/ecs2.2404,,,,,,,WOS:000449566200020,,,,,09/09/2020,90,empirical,shrub cover change,cover change,"West Virginia, US",39.1175,-79.443,,,,,,,,WOS search

The formation of through taliks as part of the transition from continuous to discontinuous permafrost creates new hydrologic pathways connecting the active layer to sub-permafrost regions, with significant hydrological and biogeochemical consequences. At hilly field sites in the southern Seward Peninsula, AK, patches of deep snow in tall shrubs are associated with higher winter ground temperatures and an anomalously deep active layer. To better understand the thermal-hydrologic controls and consequences of through taliks, we used the coupled surface/subsurface permafrost hydrology model ATS (Advanced Terrestrial Simulator) to simulate through taliks associated with preferentially distributing snow. Scenarios were developed based on an intensively studied hillslope transect on the southern Seward Peninsula, which predominately has taller shrubs midslope and tundra in upslope and downslope areas. The model was forced with detrended meteorological data with snow preferentially distributed at the midslope of the domain to investigate the potential role of vegetation-induced snow trapping in controlling through talik development under conditions typical of the current-day Seward Peninsula. Wesimulated thermal hydrology and talik development for five permafrost conditions ranging in thickness from 17-45 m. For the three thinnest permafrost configurations, a through talik developed, which allowed water from the seasonally thawed layer into sub-permafrost waters, increasing sub-permafrost groundwater flow. These numerical experiments suggest that in the transition from continuous to discontinuous permafrost, through taliks may appear at locations that preferential trap snow and that the appearance of those through taliks may drive significant changes in permafrost hydrology.",,,,"JAFAROV, ELCHIN/G-1616-2016","JAFAROV, ELCHIN/0000-0002-8310-3261",,,,,,,,,,,,1748-9326,,,,,OCT,2018,13,10,,,,,,,105006,10.1088/1748-9326/aadd30,,,,,,,WOS:000448170700001,,,,,09/09/2020,91,modelling,hydrology,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We developed a remote sensing approach that maps formation and disappearance of ponds associated with beaver activity.

It is unclear how improved tundra stream habitat, population rebound following overtrapping for furs, or other factors are contributing to beaver range expansion. We discuss rates and likely routes of tundra beaver colonization, as well as effects on permafrost, stream ice regimes, and freshwater and riparian habitat. Beaver ponds and associated hydrologic changes are thawing permafrost.

Understanding how herbivory influences the resilience of Arctic ecosystems to ongoing environmental changes is essential to inform policy and guide sustainable management practices. However, many studies indicate that the effects of herbivores on plants and ecosystem functioning depend on the abiotic and biotic conditions where the interaction takes place, i.e. the ecological context. Yet, the range of ecological contexts in which herbivory has been studied in the Arctic has not been systematically assessed. A lack of such evaluation prevents understanding the robustness and generalizability of our knowledge of Arctic herbivore effects on vegetation and ecosystems. The main objective of our systematic map is to identify the ecological contexts where herbivory is studied in the Arctic. Hence, this systematic map will enable us to assess our ability to make generalizable and robust conclusions regarding the impacts of Arctic herbivory. Methods: We will search academic and grey literature using databases, search engines and specialist websites, and select studies addressing the response of the plant(s) to herbivory, deemed relevant in terms of (i) population (terrestrial Arctic plants and plant communities), (ii) exposure (herbivory, including disturbance and fertilization effects of herbivores), and (iii) modifier (ecological context being in the terrestrial Arctic including forest-tundra).

Yet, remote-sensing data and retrospective growth analyses of the circumpolar dwarf shrub, Cassiope tetragona, commonly show considerable between-year variability in plant growth in response to variation in summer temperature. Given that both Cassiope growth and vascular plant biomass production share a common environmental driver, summer temperature, we would expect positive co-variation between them. Here we investigate whether this is indeed the case and if so over what spatial scale. LocationMethodsNordenskioldland, high arctic Svalbard. We brought dendroecology and plot-based field estimation methodologies together in an empirical study using retrospective analysis of Cassiope growth and annual estimation of above-ground vegetation biomass production to investigate their temporal and spatial co-variation and sensitivity to summer weather conditions. ResultsConclusionsDespite substantial small-scale heterogeneity, we found spatial co-variation in Cassiope growth patterns, which weakened as distance between sampling sites increased from 0 to 25km. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between annual estimates of above-ground live vascular plant biomass and Cassiope shoot growth over a 12-year period at a local scale. The correlation declined with distance, likely due to increasing differences in local weather conditions. We demonstrate that Cassiope growth can be used as a proxy for above-ground tundra vegetation productivity at the local scale. Our findings suggest that Arctic plant productivity is as sensitive to between-year variation in summer temperature as the well-established growth response of Cassiope. This challenges the view that tundra plant productivity varies little between years and provides a mechanistic understanding that helps reconcile field- and satellite-based annual estimation methods.",,,,"Milner, Jos M./G-7722-2012","Milner, Jos M./0000-0003-0229-3655; Stien, Audun/0000-0001-8046-7337",,,,,,,,,,,,1100-9233,1654-1103,,,,SEP,2018,29,5,,,,,943,951,,10.1111/jvs.12679,,,,,,,WOS:000448180400014,,,,,09/09/2020,94,empirical,biomass production,biomass,"Svalbard, NO",78.333,15,dendrochronology; biomass harvest,growth,biotic,Cassiope tetragona,1,species,,WOS search

However, we do not yet know how Arctic shrub expansion will impact ecosystem carbon (C) cycling and this limits our ability to forecast changes in net C storage and resulting climate feedbacks. Here we quantify the allocation of photosynthate between different ecosystem components for two common deciduous Arctic shrubs, both of which are increasing in abundance in the study region; green alder (Alnus viridis (Chaix) DC.) and dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa Michx., B.). Using C-13 isotopic labelling, we show that carbon use efficiency (i.e. the fraction of gross photosynthesis remaining after subtracting respiration) in peak growing season is similar between the two shrubs (56 +/- 12% for A. viridis, 59 +/- 6% for B. glandulosa), but that biomass production efficiency (plant C uptake allocated to biomass production, per unit gross photosynthesis) is 56 +/- 14% for A. viridis, versus 31 +/- 2% for B. glandulosa. A significantly greater proportion of recent photosynthate is allocated to woody biomass in A. viridis dominated plots (27 +/- 5%), compared to plots dominated by B. glandulosa (4 +/- 1%). Allocation of C to belowground pools also differs significantly; after 2.5 weeks we recovered 28 +/- 6% of recent photosynthate in root-free soil under B. glandulosa, but under A. viridis we were unable to detect recent photosynthate in the soil. We provide the first evidence that the impact of shrub expansion on Arctic C cycling will be species dependant. Where Betula dominates, similar to 1/3 of recently photosynthesised C will be rapidly allocated belowground to soil and microbial pools. Where Alnus dominates, more recently fixed C will be allocated to woody biomass.

To quantify past landscape changes as a guide to assessing future climate impacts to the YKD and how indigenous society may adapt to change, we photo-interpreted ecotypes at 600 points within 12 grids in a 2118 km(2) area along the central YKD coast using a time-series of air photos from 1948-1955 and 1980 and satellite images from 2007-2008 (IKONOS) and 2013-2016 (WorldView). We found that ecotype classes changed 16.2% (342 km(2)) overall during the similar to 62 years. Ecotypes changed 6.0% during 1953-1980, 7.2% during 1980-2007 and 3.8% during 2007-2015. Lowland Moist Birch-Ericaceous Low Scrub (-5.0%) and Coastal Saline Flat Barrens (-2.3%) showed the greatest decreases in area, while Lowland Water Sedge Meadow (+1.7%) and Lacustrine Marestail Marsh (+1.3%) showed the largest increases. Dominant processes affecting change were permafrost degradation (5.3%), channel erosion (3.0%), channel deposition (2.2%), vegetation colonization (2.3%) and lake drainage (1.5%), while sedimentation, water-level fluctuations, permafrost aggradation and shoreline paludification each affected <0.5% of the area. Rates of change increased dramatically in the late interval for permafrost degradation (from 0.06 to 0.26%/year) and vegetation colonization (from 0.03 to 0.16%/year), while there was a small decrease in channel deposition (from 0.05 to 0.0%/year) due largely to barren mudflats being colonized by vegetation. In contrast, rates of channel erosion remained fairly constant. The increased permafrost degradation coincided with increasing storm frequency and air temperatures. We attribute increased permafrost degradation and vegetation colonization during the recent interval mostly to the effects of a large storm in 2005, which caused extensive salt-kill of vegetation along the margins of permafrost plateaus and burial of vegetation on active tidal flats by mud that was later recolonized. Due to the combination of extremely flat terrain, sea-level rise, sea-ice reduction that facilitates more storm flooding and accelerating permafrost degradation, we believe the YKD is the most vulnerable region in the Arctic to climate warming.",,,,"Frost, Gerald/K-2971-2019","Frost, Gerald/0000-0002-5134-0334",,,,,,,,,,,,2072-4292,,,,,AUG,2018,10,8,,,,,,,1280,10.3390/rs10081280,,,,,,,WOS:000443618100116,,,,,09/09/2020,96,empirical,land cover change,cover,"Alaska, US",61,-165,remote sensing,erosion; sedimentation; water-level fluctuation; permafrost; succession,abiotic,,unknown,landscape,,WOS search

Although topography, hydrology, and edaphic factors are known to influence shrubification patterns, a better understanding of the landscape-scale factors driving this phenomenon is needed to accurately predict its impacts on ecosystem function. In this study, we generated land cover change models in order to identify variables driving shrub cover increase near Umiujaq (Quebec, Canada). Using land cover maps from 1990/1994 and 2010, we modeled observed changes using two contrasting conceptual approaches: binomial modeling of transitions to shrub dominance and multinomial modeling of all land cover transitions. Models were used to generate spatially explicit predictions of transition to shrub dominance in the near future as well as long-term predictions of the abundance of different land cover types. Model predictions were validated using both field data and current Landsat-derived trends of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increase in the region in order to assess their consistency with observed patterns of change. We found that both variables related to topography and to vegetation were useful in modeling land cover changes occurring near Umiujaq. Shrubs tended to preferentially colonize low-elevation areas and moderate slopes, while their cover was more likely to increase in the vicinity of existing shrub patches. Deterministic realizations of the spatially explicit models of land cover change had a good predictive capability, although they performed better at predicting the proportion of different cover types than at predicting the precise location of the changes. Binomial models performed as well as multinomial models, indicating that neglecting land cover changes other than shrubification does not result in decreased prediction accuracy. The predicted probabilities of shrub increase in the region were consistent with patterns of change inferred from field data, but only partly supported by recent local increases in NDVI.

We present evidence from diagnostic and inversion models constrained by satellite fluorescence and airborne CO2 from 2012 to 2014 indicating the timing and magnitude of spring carbon uptake in Alaska correlates with landscape thaw and ecoregion. Landscape thaw in boreal forests typically occurs in late April (DOY 111 +/- 7) with a 29 +/- 6 day lag until photosynthetic onset. North Slope tundra thaws 3weeks later (DOY 133 +/- 5) but experiences only a 20 +/- 5 day lag until photosynthetic onset. These time lag differences reflect efficient cold season adaptation in tundra shrub and the longer dehardening period for boreal evergreens. Despite the short transition from thaw to photosynthetic onset in tundra, synchrony of tundra respiration with snow melt and landscape thaw delays the transition from net carbon loss (at photosynthetic onset) to net uptake by 13 +/- 7 days, thus reducing the tundra net carbon uptake period. Two global CO2 inversions using a CASA-GFED model prior estimate earlier northern high latitude net carbon uptake compared to our regional inversion, which we attribute to (i) early photosynthetic-onset model prior bias, (ii) inverse method (scaling factor+optimization window), and (iii) sparsity of available Alaskan CO2 observations. Another global inversion with zero prior estimates the same timing for net carbon uptake as the regional model but smaller seasonal amplitude. The analysis of Alaskan eddy covariance observations confirms regional scale findings for tundra, but indicates that photosynthesis and net carbon uptake occur up to 1 month earlier in evergreens than captured by models or CO2 inversions, with better correlation to above-freezing air temperature than date of primary thaw.

Such changes have affected the near-surface climate through opposing biogeophysical feedbacks (BF) associated with changes to albedo and evapotranspiration. However, the likely spatiotemporal variations of BF to future climate change and the consequences for Arctic vegetation and ecology have not been robustly quantified. We apply a regional Earth system model (RCA-GUESS) interactively coupling atmospheric dynamics to land vegetation response in three potential 21st-century radiative forcing simulations for the Arctic. We find that BF, dominated by albedo-mediated warming in early spring and evapotranspiration-mediated cooling in summer, have the potential to amplify or modulate local warming and enhance summer precipitation over land. The magnitude of these effects depends on radiative forcing and subsequent ecosystem responses. Thus, it is important to account for BF when assessing future Arctic climate change and its ecosystem impacts. Plain Language Summary Arctic terrestrial ecosystems are in a state of transition due to their responses to rapid warming observed in recent decades. The changes in distribution and composition of terrestrial ecosystems may induce biogeophysical feedbacks that modulate the Arctic climate. Few studies, however, have quantified the impacts of such feedbacks by accounting for the tight coupling between physical forcing factors and transient vegetation responses to the evolving climate. Using a fully coupled regional Earth system model (RCA-GUESS), we discern impacts of biogeophysical feedbacks on regional climates at various levels of radiative forcing. We find that feedbacks dominated by albedo-mediated warming in early spring and evapotranspiration-mediated cooling in summer can strongly alter the future AC changes. This study indicates that biogeophysical interactions between the Arctic climate and land vegetation may shift seasonal profiles of temperature and precipitation, and should be taken into account in future assessments of climate change and its impacts in the Arctic.",,,,"Mao, Jiafu/B-9689-2012; Smith, Benjamin/I-1212-2016","Mao, Jiafu/0000-0002-2050-7373; Smith, Benjamin/0000-0002-6987-5337; Zhang, Wenxin/0000-0001-9477-563X; Miller, Paul/0000-0003-1105-2132",,,,,,,,,,,,0094-8276,1944-8007,,,,JUL 28,2018,45,14,,,,,7102,7111,,10.1029/2018GL077830,,,,,,,WOS:000442582100039,,,,,09/09/2020,99,modelling,ecosystem energy balance,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We investigated the links between soil carbon stocks, soil organic matter decomposition, vegetation heterogeneity, temperature, and environmental sensitivities in dwarf shrub tundra near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. We quantified carbon stocks of forty-two soil profiles using bulk density estimates based on previous studies in the region. The soil profiles were located within six vegetation types at nine study sites, distributed across an environmental gradient. We also monitored air and soil temperature and measured in situ soil respiration to quantify variation in carbon flux between vegetation types. For spatial extrapolation, we created a high-resolution land cover classification map of the study area. Aside from a single soil profile taken from a fen soil (54.55 kg C m(-2); 2.13 kg N m(-2)), the highest carbon stocks were found in wet grassland soils (mean, 95% CI: 34.87 kg C m(-2), [27.30, 44.55]). These same grassland soils also had the highest mid-growing-season soil respiration rates. Our estimation of soil carbon stocks and mid-growing-season soil respiration measurements indicate that grassland soils are a hot spot for soil carbon storage and soil carbon dioxide efflux. Even though shrub, steppe, and mixed vegetation had lower average soil carbon stocks (14.66 - 20.17 kg C m(-2)), these vegetation types played an important role in carbon cycling at the landscape scale because they cover approximately 50 percent of the terrestrial landscape and store approximately 68 percent of the landscape soil organic carbon. The heterogeneous soil carbon stocks in this landscape may be sensitive to key environmental changes, such as shrub expansion and climate change. These environmental drivers could possibly result in a trend toward decreased soil carbon storage and increased release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1523-0430,1938-4246,,,,JUN 11,2018,50,1,,,,,,,e1420283,10.1080/15230430.2017.1420283,,,,,,,WOS:000438749100001,,,,,09/09/2020,100,empirical,soil carbon stocks,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

However, little is known about other factors influencing shrub ring growth, possibly obscuring their climate signal. For example, as of yet we are not able to differentiate between herbivory or climatically induced growth depressions. Here, we use one of the most common Arctic shrubs, Alnus viridis as a test case to address this question. We sampled Alnus in Kobbefjord, Greenland, measured shrub-ring width and cell wall thickness and built site chronologies of each parameter. We analysed climate-growth relationships, tested their stability over time and employed a pointer-year analysis to detect growth depressions. We employed bootstrapped transfer function stability tests (BTFS) to assess the suitability of our shrub chronologies for climate reconstruction. Correlations with climate data showed strong significantly positive and stable correlations between summer temperature and ring-width with the exception of the recent decade. A climate reconstruction model failed stability tests, when the complete period of record was used for calibration and verification. Wood anatomy analysis uncovered the occurrence of unusual cell structure (very thin cell walls) in the exceptionally narrow ring of 2004, a recorded insect outbreak year in other parts of Greenland. When excluding the affected ring and a recovery period, the reconstruction model passed all tests, suggesting that the unusual 2004 ring was not climate driven, but rather the result of an insect attack. When combining anatomical analysis with traditional ring-width measurements, we move a step further in potentially distinguishing small rings caused by insect attacks from small rings formed in climatically challenging years. While this study does not provide unambiguous evidence, it does provide potential useful methodological combinations to enable more robust climate reconstructions in areas where climatic records are extremely sparse.",,,,"Buras, Allan/B-1412-2012; Wilmking, Martin/AAV-9310-2020","Wilmking, Martin/0000-0003-4964-2402; van der Maaten, Ernst/0000-0002-5218-6682; Shetti, Rohan/0000-0002-2967-0193; Buras, Allan/0000-0003-2179-0681; Lange, Jelena/0000-0002-7872-6667",,,,,,,,,,,,1125-7865,1612-0051,,,,JUN,2018,49,,,,,,36,43,,10.1016/j.dendro.2018.02.010,,,,,,,WOS:000433995400005,,,,,09/09/2020,102,empirical,shrub ring width,growth,"Kobbefjord, GL",64.137,-51.38,dendrochronology,herbivory,biotic,Alnus glutinosa,1,species,,WOS search

Prior to the HLL event, the carbon assimilation rate was primarily limited by irradiance as reflected in the delta C-13 data and the radial growth of south-facing riparian trees remained increased in comparison to shaded upland trees. By contrast, the riparian trees were not similarly benefited during the HLL period when reduced assimilation depleted the riparian in comparison to upland delta C-13 despite of increased irradiance. As a result, the radial growth of riparian trees was markedly reduced over the HLL event while the upland trees benefited from increased irradiance and summer time warming. Although the production of biomass at high latitudes is commonly considered temperature-limited, our results highlight the increasing role of Arctic moistening to limit the growth when increased precipitation (cloudiness) reduces the incoming solar radiation in general and when the riparian habitat becomes increasingly waterlogged in particular. The effects of high-latitude warming to induce higher biomass productivity may be restricted by negative feedbacks.",,,,,"Oinonen, Markku/0000-0002-0881-7643",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JUN,2018,24,6,,,,,2691,2707,,10.1111/gcb.14058,,,,,,,WOS:000433717700037,29436149,,,,09/09/2020,103,empirical,riparian tree ring width,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

This represents a critical gap in the assessment of land-based production systems and the ability to inform policy related to the bio-economy. Combining satellite remote sensing and meteorological data sets, this study develops two new sets of spatially-differentiated and globally applicable characterisation factors (CFs) to assess the environmental impact of green water flows in LCA. One set of CFs addresses the impact of shifts in water vapour flow by evapotranspiration on blue water availability (CMS) and the other set of Cis addresses moisture recycling within a basin (CTWA) Furthermore, as an additional and optional step, these two indicators are combined into an aggregated green water scarcity indicator, representing the global variability of green water scarcity. The values obtained for CFWA show that there are significant changes in green water flows that were returned to the atmosphere in Alaska (covered by open shrublancls) and in some central regions of China (covered by grasslands and barren or sparsely vegetated land), where precipitation levels are lower than 10 mm/yr. The results obtained for CFWS indicate that severe perturbations in surface blue water production occur, particularly in central regions of China (covered by grasslands), the southeast of Australia (covered by evergreen broadleaf forest) and in some central regions of the USA (covered by grassland and evergreen needleleaf forest). The application of the green water scarcity CFs enables the evaluation of the potential environmental impact due to green water consumption by agricultural and forestry products, informing both technical and non-technical audiences and decision-makers for the purpose of strategic planning of land use and to identify green water protection measures.

Conversely, large herbivores have the potential to counteract the positive impacts of climate change on shrub growth. Indeed, by stripping the leaves, herbivores have the potential to control the growth of shrub species and, consequently, limit their expansion. To disentangle the impacts of climate change and herbivory on Betula glandulosa Michx., we conducted a 5-year factorial experiment near Deception Bay, Nunavik, Canada, in which we simulated warmer temperatures, increased nitrogen availability and three caribou browsing intensities during the growing season. At the end of the experiment, we harvested the above-ground biomass of B. glandulosa and conducted dendrochronological analyses on stems. Fertilised plots under ambient temperature had 34% greater shrub biomass than plots assigned to the combined treatment of nitrogen addition and warmer temperatures. Browsing intensity had no effect on final biomass. Nitrogen addition increased radial growth (18%-33%; 3years out of 5). Overall, browsing had a cumulative negative impact on B. glandulosa radial growth during the 5-year experiment. While browsing had no effect in the first year of the experiment, moderate browsing (leaves stripped on 25% of available shoots) decreased radial growth by 27% at year 2, 32% at year 4 and 27% at year 5. Heavy browsing (leaves stripped on 75% of available shoots annually) decreased radial growth by c. 27% at year 2, 37% at year 3, 50% at year 4 and 48% at year 5. We did not observe significant interactions between browsing, temperature and nitrogen availability.Synthesis. Our results clearly showed that caribou browsing may limit the growth of B. glandulosa, and thus can potentially limit its expansion.

Despite these changes, the driving factors that control shrubification and its future trajectory remain uncertain. Here we used an ecosystem model, ecosys, to mechanistically represent the processes controlling recent and 21st century changes in plant functional type using RCP8.5 climate forcing across North American Arctic tundra. Recent and projected warming was modeled to deepen the active layer (spatially averaged by similar to 0.35m by 2100) and thereby increase nutrient availability. Shrub productivity was modeled to increase across much of the tundra, particularly in Alaska and tundra-boreal ecotones. Deciduous and evergreen shrubs increased from similar to 45% of total tundra ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) in recent decades to similar to 70% by 2100. The increased canopy cover of shrubs reduced incoming shortwave radiation for low-lying plants, causing declines in graminoids NPP from a current 35% of tundra NPP to 18%, and declines in nonvascular plants from 20% to 12%. The faster-growing deciduous shrubs modeled with less efficient nutrient conservation dominated much of the low Arctic by 2100 where nutrient cycling became more rapid, while the slower-growing evergreen shrubs modeled with more efficient nutrient conservation dominated a wider latitudinal range that extended to the high Arctic where nutrient cycling remained slower. We conclude that high-latitude vegetation dynamics over the 21st century will depend strongly on soil nutrient dynamics, diversity in plant traits controlling nutrient uptake and conservation, and light competition.",,,,"Riley, William J/D-3345-2015; Mekonnen, Zelalem/M-7144-2017","Riley, William J/0000-0002-4615-2304; Mekonnen, Zelalem/0000-0002-2647-0671",,,,,,,,,,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,MAY,2018,123,5,,,,,1683,1701,,10.1029/2017JG004319,,,,,,,WOS:000435264200017,,,,,09/09/2020,106,modelling,shrub cover change; shrub productivity,cover; productivity,North-American Arctic,,,modelling,temperature; permafrost thaw,abiotic,,unknown,ecosystem,,WOS search

The widespread expansion of woody shrubs into historically herbaceous alpine plant zones is likely to interact with climate to affect soil microbial community structure and function; however, our understanding of alpine soil ecology remains limited. This study aimed to (i) determine whether the diversity and community composition of soil fungi vary across elevation gradients and to (ii) assess the impact of woody shrub expansion on these patterns. In the White Mountains of California, sagebrush (Artemisia rothrockii) shrubs have been expanding upwards into alpine areas since 1960. In this study, we combined observational field data with a manipulative shrub removal experiment along an elevation transect of alpine shrub expansion. We utilized next-generation sequencing of the ITS1 region for fungi and joint distribution modelling to tease apart effects of the environment and intracommunity interactions on soil fungi. We found that soil fungal diversity declines and community composition changes with increasing elevation. Both abiotic factors (primarily soil moisture and soil organic C) and woody sagebrush range expansion had significant effects on these patterns. However, fungal diversity and relative abundance had high spatial variation, overwhelming the predictive power of vegetation type, elevation and abiotic soil conditions at the landscape scale.

Decomposed SOC could become hydrologically accessible, which increase downstream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and subsequent carbon release to the atmosphere, constituting a positive feedback to climate warming. However, DOC export is often neglected in ecosystem models. In this paper, we incorporate processes related to DOC production, mineralization, diffusion, sorption-desorption, and leaching into a customized arctic version of the dynamic ecosystem model LPJ-GUESS in order to mechanistically model catchment DOC export, and to link this flux to other ecosystem processes. The extended LPJ-GUESS is compared to observed DOC export at Stordalen catchment in northern Sweden. Vegetation communities include flood-tolerant graminoids (Eriophorum) and Sphagnum moss, birch forest and dwarf shrub communities. The processes, sorption-desorption and microbial decomposition (DOC production and mineralization) are found to contribute most to the variance in DOC export based on a detailed variance-based Sobol sensitivity analysis (SA) at grid cell-level. Catchment-level SA shows that the highest mean DOC exports come from the Eriophorum peatland (fen). A comparison with observations shows that the model captures the seasonality of DOC fluxes. Two catchment simulations, one without water lateral routing and one without peatland processes, were compared with the catchment simulations with all processes. The comparison showed that the current implementation of catchment lateral flow and peatland processes in LPJ-GUESS are essential to capture catchment-level DOC dynamics and indicate the model is at an appropriate level of complexity to represent the main mechanism of DOC dynamics in soils. The extended model provides a new tool to investigate potential interactions among climate change, vegetation dynamics, soil hydrology and DOC dynamics at both stand-alone to catchment scales.

Impacts of future greening of the Arctic region are tested using altered surface boundary conditions for hypothetical vegetation distributions: (1) grasslands poleward of 60A degrees N replaced by boreal forests and (2) both grasslands and shrubs replaced by boreal forests. Surface energy budget analysis reveals that future greening induces a considerable surface warming effect locally and warming is largely driven by an increase in short wave radiation. Both upward and downward shortwave radiation contribute to positive surface warming: upward shortwave radiation decreases mainly due to the decreased surface albedo (a darker surface) and downward shortwave radiation increases due to reduced cloud cover. The contribution of downward shortwave radiation at surface due to cloud cover reduction is larger than the contribution from surface albedo alone. The increased roughness length also transported surface fluxes to upper layer more efficiently and induce more heating and dry lower atmosphere. A relatively smaller increase in water vapor compared to the large increase in low-level air temperature in the simulation reduces relative humidity and results in reduced cloud cover. Therefore, vegetation-cloud feedbacks induced from land cover change significantly amplify Arctic warming.

Specifically, we analyzed growth of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) and its associated plant communities along an elevation gradient of ca. 600 vertical meters in the eastern European Alps. We assessed the ramet age, ring width and shoot length of V. myrtillus, and the shrub cover and plant diversity of the community. At higher elevation, ramets of V. myrtillus were younger, with shorter shoots and narrower growth rings. Shoot length was positively related to shrub cover, but shrub cover did not show a direct relationship with elevation.

Therefore, interactions between changes to tundra vegetation and soil thermal regime will fundamentally affect permafrost in a warmer world. We recorded soil temperatures for approximately 1 year in a Siberian Low Arctic landscape with a known history of alder (Alnus) shrub expansion on disturbed microsites in patterned ground. We recorded near-surface soil temperatures and measured physical properties of soils and vegetation on sorted-circle microsites in four stages of shrubland development: (1) tundra lacking tall shrubs; (2) shrub colonization zones; (3) mature shrublands; and (4) paludified, long-established shrublands with thick soil organic layers. Summer soil temperatures declined with increasing shrub cover and soil organic thickness; shrub colonization suppressed cryoturbation, facilitating the development of continuous vegetation and a surface organic mat on circles. Compared to open tundra, mature shrubs cooled soils by up to 9 A degrees C during summer, but warmed soils by greater than 10 A degrees C in winter presumably because they developed highly insulative snowpacks. Paludified shrublands had the coldest summer active layers, but winter soil temperatures were much colder than mature shrublands and were similar to earlier stages. Our results indicate that although tall shrub establishment dramatically warms winter soils within decades, much of this warming is transient at paludification-prone sites because the buildup of wet peat favors cooling in winter and the stature and snow-trapping capacity of shrubs diminish over time. In the ecosystem we studied, shrub expansion has contrasting effects on active-layer temperatures both seasonally and over longer timescales due to successional processes.",,,,"Ermokhina, Ksenia/D-8601-2017; Frost, Gerald/K-2971-2019","Ermokhina, Ksenia/0000-0001-6924-2129; Frost, Gerald/0000-0002-5134-0334",,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,APR,2018,21,3,,,,,507,520,,10.1007/s10021-017-0165-5,,,,,,,WOS:000428556200009,,,,,09/09/2020,111,empirical,soil temperatures,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Composition and content of photosynthetic pigments is finely tuned by plants according to a subtle equilibrium between the absorbed and used energy by the photosynthetic apparatus. Subarctic and Arctic plants are subjected to extended periods of continuous light during summer. This condition represents a unique natural scenario to study the influence of light on pigment regulation and the presence of diurnal patterns potentially governed by circadian rhythms. Here, we examined the modulation of the photosynthetic apparatus in three naturally co-occurring woody species: mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) around the summer solstice, at 67 A degrees N latitude. Plants were continuously exposed to solar radiation during the 3-day study period, although PPFD fluctuated, being lower during night-times. Photochemical efficiencies for a given PPFD were similar during daytime and night-time for the three species. In Scots pine, for a given PPFD, net assimilation was slightly higher during daytime than during night-time. Overall, the dynamism in pigment content was mainly driven by PPFD, and was generally unrelated to day/night cycles. Weak indications of potential circadian regulation were found over a few pigments only. Interestingly, the xanthophyll cycle was active at any time of the day in the three species but its responsiveness to PPFD was exacerbated during night-times. This was particularly evident for bearberry, which maintained a highly de-epoxidised state even at night-times.

The study was conducted in the area of the Fuglebergsletta coastal plain, in the vicinity of the Polish Polar Station (Wedel Jarlsberg Land, SW Spitsbergen). Relationships between the studied phenomenon and basic environmental factors and climate indicators were evaluated. The spatial variation of land surface temperatures (LST) was determined, as were the effects of the physical and chemical properties of soils and the spring melting of snow cover on growth rates. It has been argued that the spatial and seasonal variability of annual growth is determined by the rate at which snow cover disappears and by soil moisture, which determines plants' access to water. Soil moisture depends on soil particle size distribution and weather; it is regulated by the supply of snowmelt water and rainfall as well as by the depth of the top layer of permafrost (thaw depth), which determines the level of groundwater during the growing season. The spatial characteristics of the process of the disappearance of seasonal snow cover are co-determined by the morphology of the substrate and the physical properties of the soil. An important but destructive role is played by thawing episodes, which are increasingly frequent in the winter season, 'rain-on-snow' events, and glaze ice. The values of correlation coefficients indicate a positive role for precipitation and negative influence of temperature. The higher the temperature (along with low precipitation), the lesser the extent of plant growth. The observed trend towards warming in polar areas does not inevitably lead to an increase in biomass production. An increase in temperature during the growing season does not necessarily promote plant growth, but rather indicates drought stress caused by the lowering of groundwater levels related to the increase in thaw depth.",,,,"Luks, Bartlomiej/J-7762-2013; Piroznikow, Ewa/E-4617-2019; Szymanowski, Mariusz/P-7971-2018; Kepski, Daniel/AAE-7205-2020; Opala-Owczarek, Magdalena/M-4372-2015","Luks, Bartlomiej/0000-0003-2287-385X; Piroznikow, Ewa/0000-0002-9550-3262; Szymanowski, Mariusz/0000-0003-2556-3187; Kepski, Daniel/0000-0001-7903-2942; Opala-Owczarek, Magdalena/0000-0002-0583-6443; Migala, Krzysztof/0000-0003-0881-8109; Owczarek, Piotr/0000-0001-7877-7731",,,,,,,,,,,,0341-8162,1872-6887,,,,APR,2018,163,,,,,,219,232,,10.1016/j.catena.2017.12.018,,,,,,,WOS:000427332000020,,,,,09/09/2020,114,empirical,shrub growth,growth,"Svalbard, NO",77.02,15.32,dendrochronology,temperature,abiotic,Salix polaris; Saxifraga oppositifolia,2,species,,WOS search

However, the responses of contrasting shrub species growing at the same sites to climate drivers remain largely unexplored. Here, we test growth, climate, and NDVI relationships of two contrasting species: the expanding tall deciduous shrub Salix pulchra and the circumarctic evergreen dwarf shrub Cassiope tetragona from an alpine tundra site in the Pika valley in the Kluane Region, southwest Yukon Territories, Canada. We found that annual growth variability of both species at this site is strongly driven by early summer temperatures, despite their contrasting traits and habitats. Shrub growth chronologies for both species were correlated with the regional climate signal and showed spatial correspondence with interannual variation in NDVI in surrounding alpine and Arctic regions.

Climate warming is predicted to alter ecological boundaries in high-latitude ecosystems including the elevational or latitudinal extent of tall shrubs in Arctic and alpine tundra. Over 60 studies from 128 locations around the tundra biome have investigated shrub expansion in tundra ecosystems; however, only six studies test whether shrublines are actually advancing up hill-slopes or northward into tundra where tall shrubs are currently absent. 2. We test the hypothesis that willow shrublines have expanded to higher elevations in relation to climate across a 50 x 50 km area in the Kluane Region of the southwest Yukon Territory, Canada by surveying of 379 shrubs at 14 sites and sampling of 297 of the surveyed shrubs at 10 sites. We compared growth and recruitment to climate variables to test the climate sensitivity of shrub increase using annual radial growth analysis, age distributions and repeat field surveys to estimate the current rate of shrubline advance. 3. We found consistent and increasing rates of recruitment of alpine willows, with estimates of faster advancing shrublines on shallower hill-slopes. Mortality was extremely low across the elevation gradient. Aspect, elevation and species identity did not explain variation in recruitment patterns, suggesting a regional factor, such as climate, as the driver of the observed shrubline advance. 4. Annual radial growth of willows was best explained by variation in summer temperatures, and recruitment pulses by winter temperatures. Measured recruitment rates are similar to 20 +/- 5 individuals per hectare per decade (M +/- SE) and measured rates of increased shrub cover of similar to 5 +/- 1% per decade (M +/- SE) measured at the Pika Camp site between field surveys in 2009 and 2013. Our results suggest that shrubline will continue to advance over the next 50 years, if growing conditions remain suitable. However, if future conditions differ between summer and winter seasons, this could lead to contrasting trajectories for recruitment vs. growth, and influence the vegetation change observed on the landscape. 5.

Our findings in the context of a review of the existing literature indicate that elevational and latitudinal shrublines, like treelines, are advancing in response to climate warming; however, the trajectories of change will depend on the climate drivers controlling recruitment vs. growth.",,,,"Myers-Smith, Isla H/D-1529-2013; Hik, David S/B-3462-2009","Myers-Smith, Isla H/0000-0002-8417-6112; Hik, David S/0000-0002-8994-9305",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,MAR,2018,106,2,,,,,547,560,,10.1111/1365-2745.12817,,,,,,,WOS:000425046300009,,,,,09/09/2020,116,empirical,shrub growth; shrub recruitment; shrub cover,growth; recruitment; cover,"Yukon, CA",61.1,-138.6,dendrochronology; cover estimates,temperature,abiotic,Salix alaxensis var. alaxensis; Salix barrattiana; Salix glauca var. acutifolia; Salix niphoclada; Salix pulchra; Salix richardsonii,6,community,,WOS search

Future vegetation trends (e.g. the arctic greening) will feed back into atmospheric circulation and the global climate system. Understanding the nature and causes of past vegetation changes is important for predicting the composition and distribution of future vegetation communities. Fossil pollen records from 468 sites in northern and eastern Asia were biomised at selected times between 40 cal ka bp and today. Biomes were also simulated using a climate-driven biome model and results from the two approaches compared in order to help understand the mechanisms behind the observed vegetation changes. The consistent biome results inferred by both approaches reveal that long-term and broad-scale vegetation patterns reflect global- to hemispheric-scale climate changes. Forest biomes increase around the beginning of the late deglaciation, become more widespread during the early and middle Holocene, and decrease in the late Holocene in fringe areas of the Asian Summer Monsoon. At the southern and southwestern margins of the taiga, forest increases in the early Holocene and shows notable species succession, which may have been caused by winter warming at ca. 7 cal ka bp. At the northeastern taiga margin (central Yakutia and northeastern Siberia), shrub expansion during the last deglaciation appears to prevent the permafrost from thawing and hinders the northward expansion of evergreen needle-leaved species until ca. 7 cal ka bp.

Most Arctic climate impact studies focus on single factors, such as summer warming, while ecosystems are exposed to changes in all seasons. Through a combination of field and laboratory manipulations, we compared physiological and growth responses of dominant sub-Arctic plant types to midwinter warming events (6 A degrees C for 7 days) in combination with freezing, simulated snow thaw and nitrogen additions. We aimed to identify if different plant types showed consistent physiological, cellular, growth and mortality responses to these abiotic stressors. Evergreen dwarf shrubs and tree seedlings showed higher mortality (40-100%) following extreme winter warming events than Betula pubescens tree seedlings and grasses (0-27%). All species had growth reductions following exposure to - 20 A degrees C, but not all species suffered from - 10 A degrees C irrespective of other treatments. Winter warming followed by - 20 A degrees C resulted in the greatest mortality and was strongest among evergreen plants. Snow removal reduced the biomass for most species and this was exacerbated by subsequent freezing. Nitrogen increased the growth of B. pubescens and grasses, but not the evergreens, and interaction effects with the warming, freezing and snow treatments were minor and few. Physiological activity during the winter warming and freezing treatments was inconsistent with growth and mortality rates across the plants types. However, changes in the membrane fatty acids were associated with reduced mortality of grasses.

However, the extent to which shrubs may benefit from these conditions may be strongly dependent on the following spring climate. Species-specific differences in phenology and spring frost sensitivity likely affect shrub growth responses to warming. Additionally, effects of changes in winter and spring climate may differ over small spatial scales, as shrub growth may be dependent on natural variation in snow cover, shrub density and cryoturbation. We investigated the effects of winter warming and altered spring climate on growing-season performance of three common and widespread shrub species in cryoturbated non-sorted circle arctic tundra. By insulating sparsely vegetated non-sorted circles and parts of the surrounding heath with additional snow or gardening fleeces, we created two climate change scenarios: snow addition increased soil temperatures in autumn and winter and delayed snowmelt timing without increasing spring temperatures, whereas fleeces increased soil temperature similarly in autumn and winter, but created warmer spring conditions without altering snowmelt timing. Winter warming affected shrub performance, but the direction and magnitude were species-specific and dependent on spring conditions. Spring warming advanced, and later snowmelt delayed canopy green-up. The fleece treatment did not affect shoot growth and biomass in any shrub species despite decreasing leaf frost damage in Empetrum nigrum. Snow addition decreased frost damage and stimulated growth of Vaccinium vitis-idaea by c. 50%, while decreasing Betula nana growth (p < .1). All of these effects were consistent the mostly barren circles and surrounding heath. Synthesis. In cryoturbated arctic tundra, growth of Vaccinium vitis-idaea may substantially increase when a thicker snow cover delays snowmelt, whereas in longer term, warmer winters and springs may favour E. nigrum instead. This may affect shrub community composition and cover, with potentially far-reaching effects on arctic ecosystem functioning via its effects on cryoturbation, carbon cycling and trophic cascading.

It is uncertain, however, if this trend will persist in the future. Our study examined growth responses of deciduous shrubs to climate change over the late 20th and early 21st centuries near Kangerlussuaq in western Greenland. We combined shrub dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis and weekly measurements of leaf gas exchange to examine the drivers of secondary growth in two widespread and dominant deciduous shrub species: Salix glauca and Betula nana. Betula showed a dramatic growth decline beginning in the early 1990s, when correlations between growing season air temperature and growth shifted from neutral to strongly negative. Salix also showed a growth decline, but it began slightly later and was more pronounced among older stems. May-August mean air temperature of c. 7 degrees C appeared to be an important threshold. Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) in alpha-cellulose of Salix growth rings declined strongly during the period of reduced growth, suggesting drought-induced stomatal closure as a possible cause. Leaf gas exchange of Salix was also highly sensitive to seasonal variation in moisture availability. Betula growth declined more dramatically than Salix, but leaf gas exchange was less sensitive to moisture availability and there was less evidence of a Delta C-13 trend. We hypothesize that the dramatic Betula growth decline might reflect the combined effects of increasing moisture limitation, repeated defoliation during recent moth outbreaks and greater browsing by a growing muskoxen population. Synthesis. Our findings contrast with widespread observations of increasing shrub growth in the Arctic and instead point to a potential decline in the flux of carbon into a pool with a long mean residence time (wood).

The vegetation dynamics of these two peatlands were driven by autogenic processes reflecting the development trajectory of the peatlands towards ombrotrophic status, and allogenic climate change. We observe an increase in shrub pollen and macrofossils (e.g. Ericaceae, Betula nana) during two Late Holocene warm episodes and in recent decades. Pollen data suggest that regional forest cover also responded to temperature increase since ca. 1950 CE. An increase of Picea pollen (up to 13%) in the upper part of peat profile is probably associated with long distance pollen transport from populations of Picea mariana and Picea glauca located at the southern foothills of the Brooks Range. Relatively small amount of micro- and macrocharcoal in the two profiles indicates little fire activity around the sampling sites over the last ca. 2000 years, which is in agreement with regional findings.

Here we assess tundra plant community changes along a temperature gradient and how these are modified in the presence of the common allelopathic dwarf shrub Empetrum nigrum and the large herbivore Rangifer tarandus. We developed a structural equation model based on data from a field-based study of 1450 tundra plant communities across Northern Fennoscandia, covering a temperature gradient of 3.5 degrees C, contrasting Rangifer densities, a range of Empetrum abundances in addition to gradients in topography and bedrock. We found temperature to be a significant positive predictor of Empetrum, herbaceous and woody plant abundances. However, the effect of temperature as predictor for herbaceous plant abundance was significantly reduced in communities with Empetrum present. For woody plant abundance Empetrum was a stronger predictor than temperature. In comparison, we found Rangifer density to have marginal or no effect on either herbaceous or woody plant abundance. These findings were not modified by either topography or bedrock. Results from this study indicate that herbaceous plant responses to climate warming are currently reduced in communities where Empetrum is present, whereas the abundance of Empetrum and other woody plants is promoted. Results also indicate that any future Empetrum encroachment is likely to drive tundra communities towards slower process rates and lower biodiversity.

Both abiotic stress and species interactions can limit populations and potentially set range boundaries, but we have a poor understanding of when and where each is most critical. A commonly cited hypothesis, first proposed by Darwin, posits that abiotic factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation) are stronger determinants of range boundaries in apparently abiotically stressful areas (stress indicates abiotic factors that reduce population growth), including desert, polar, or high-elevation environments, whereas species interactions (e.g., herbivory, competition) play a stronger role in apparently less stressful environments. We tested a core tenet of this hypothesis-that population growth rate is more strongly affected by species interactions in less stressful areas-using experimental manipulations of species interactions affecting a common herbaceous plant, Hibiscus meyeri (Malvaceae), across an aridity gradient in a semiarid African savanna. Population growth was more strongly affected by four distinct species interactions (competition with herbaceous and shrubby neighbors, herbivory, and pollination) in less stressful mesic areas than in more stressful arid sites. However, contrary to common assumptions, this effect did not arise because of greater density or diversity of interacting species in less stressful areas, but rather because aridity reduced sensitivity of population growth to these interactions. Our work supports classic predictions about the relative strength of factors regulating population growth across stress gradients, but suggests that this pattern results from a previously unappreciated mechanism that may apply to many species worldwide.",,,,,"Louthan, Allison/0000-0002-2735-6539; Palmer, Todd/0000-0001-5710-9750",,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,JAN 16,2018,115,3,,,,,543,548,,10.1073/pnas.1708436115,,,,,,,WOS:000423091400049,29284748,,,,09/09/2020,123,empirical,desert shrub population growth rates,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

The content of fine-textured materials in underlying mineral soils was positively related to OL depths measured 1 and 10 years after fire, and there was an interaction between soil texture and elevation in governing OL consumption and OL recovery a decade following fire. OL depths 10 years after fire were 2 cm greater than 1 year after fire, with a range of 19 cm of accumulation to 9 cm of subsidence. Subsidence was inversely related to the percentage of fine textures within the parent material.

This encroachment is, however, believed to remain limited to the relatively warm parts of the biome, where taller shrubs may displace shorter species. Still, climate sensitivity of shrub growth strongly differs between species and sites and High Arctic dwarf shrub species may respond rapidly to increasing temperatures in absence of taller species. In addition, it remains largely unknown whether shrubs from different functional groups from the same sites respond similarly to climate drivers. In the present study we examined the climate-growth relationships of six different site-species combinations: one evergreen and one deciduous shrub species at two alpine sites, and one evergreen dwarf shrub species at two High Arctic sites. We compared linear mixed models for each combination, explaining existing shrub growth data with site-specific interpolated monthly and seasonal climate data from the gridded meteorological dataset CRU TS4.00. Shrub growth rates were found to be sensitive to summer climate for all species at all sites. Continued and projected warming is thus likely to stimulate a further encroachment of shrubs in these systems, at least through a densification of existing stands. Dwarf shrub growth strongly responded to the recent warming at both High Arctic sites, contrasting with previous work suggesting that shrub expansion might remain limited to warmer tundra regions. At the alpine sites, growth of evergreen shrubs was found to be more dependent on summer climate than growth of deciduous shrubs, perhaps because these evergreen species are less prone to herbivory. However, biome-wide generalizations at the functional group level may be difficult to interpolate to the species level. Micro-site conditions, such as the determination of growing season length and winter soil temperatures, and influence on growing season soil moisture by snow depth, may determine the strength of the climate-growth relationships found.",,,,"Myers-Smith, Isla H/D-1529-2013; Weijers, Stef/T-8944-2019","Myers-Smith, Isla H/0000-0002-8417-6112; Weijers, Stef/0000-0003-3386-5417",,,,,,,,,,,,0014-0015,,,,,JAN-MAR,2018,72,1,,,,,63,85,,10.3112/erdkunde.2018.01.04,,,,,,,WOS:000427730800004,,,,,09/09/2020,125,empirical,shrub growth,growth,"Yukon, CA; Jensen Land, GL; Vole, NO; Svalbard, NO",83.2,-33.22,dendrochronology,temperature; precipitation,abiotic,Cassiope tetragona; Salix pulchra; Betula nana; Empetrum nigrum,4,species,,WOS search

The direction in which the vegetation shifts will co-determine whether Arctic warming is mitigated or accelerated, making the understanding of successional trajectories urgent. One of the key factors influencing the competitive relationships between plant species is their access to nutrients, depending on the depth where they take up most nutrients. However, nutrient uptake at different soil depths by tundra plant species that differ in rooting depth is unclear. LocationKytalyk Nature Reserve, northeast Siberia, Russia. MethodsWe injected N-15 to 5cm, 15cm and the thaw front of the soil in a moist tussock tundra. The absorption of N-15 by grasses, sedges, deciduous shrubs and evergreen shrubs from the three depths was compared. ResultsThe results clearly show a vertical differentiation of N uptake by these plant functional types, corresponding to their rooting strategy. Shallow-rooting dwarf shrubs were more capable of absorbing nutrients from the upper soil than from deeper soil. Deep-rooting grasses and sedges were more capable of absorbing nutrients from deeper soil than the dwarf shrubs. The natural N-15 abundances in control plants also indicate that graminoids can absorb more nutrients from the deeper soil than dwarf shrubs. ConclusionsOur results show that graminoids and shrubs in the Arctic differ in their N uptake strategies, with graminoids profiting from nutrients released at the thaw front, while shrubs mainly forage in upper soil layers. Our results suggest that tundra vegetation will become graminoid-dominated as permafrost thaw progresses and nutrient availability increases in the deep soil.",,,,"Wang, Peng/M-1696-2019; de Kroon, Hans/B-3359-2009; Maximov, Trofim/J-8964-2016; van Rijssel, Sophie/B-3096-2018; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Wang, Peng/0000-0003-0149-966X; de Kroon, Hans/0000-0001-6151-3561; Maximov, Trofim/0000-0001-7003-5653; van Rijssel, Sophie/0000-0003-2157-3441; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",,,,,,,,,,,,1100-9233,1654-1103,,,,JAN,2018,29,1,,,,,34,41,,10.1111/jvs.12593,,,,,,,WOS:000425593100006,,,,,09/09/2020,126,empirical,nitrogen uptake of tundra vegetation,nutrient uptake,"Kytalyk, RU",70.817,147.483,nitrogen isotope analysis,depth; species,biotic; abiotic,Betula nana; Rhododendron tomentosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea,3,species,,WOS search

Pollen-based qualitative vegetation reconstruction along with biome reconstruction indicate that the interglacial regional vegetation history during the MPT is characterized by a gradual replacement of forest and shrub vegetation by open herbaceous communities (i.e. tundra/cold steppe). The pollen spectra reveal seven vegetation successions that have clearly distinguishable glacial-interglacial cycles. These successions are represented by the intervals of cold deciduous forest (CLDE) biome scores changing from high to low, which are basically in phase with the variations of obliquity from maxima to minima. The dominating influence of obliquity forcing on vegetation successions contradicts with the stronger power of eccentricity, as demonstrated by the result of wavelet analysis based on landscape openness reconstruction. This discrepancy shows that a single index is insufficient for catching signals of all the impacting factors. Comparisons with vegetation and environmental changes in the Asian interior suggest that global cooling during the MPT was probably the key force driving long-term aridification in the Arctic region. The accelerated aridification after MIS 24-22 was probably caused by the additional effect of the Tibetan Plateau uplift, which played an important role on intensification of the Siberian High and westerly jet systems.",,,,"Wennrich, Volker/I-3435-2012; Andreev, Andrei/J-2701-2015; Melles, Martin/J-4070-2012","Wennrich, Volker/0000-0003-3617-1963; Andreev, Andrei/0000-0002-8745-9636; Tarasov, Pavel/0000-0002-7219-5009; Wenwei, Zhao/0000-0003-0145-6352",,,,,,,,,,,,0300-9483,1502-3885,,,,JAN,2018,47,1,,,,,137,149,,10.1111/bor.12262,,,,,,,WOS:000419039500009,,,,,09/09/2020,127,empirical,pollen composition,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Thermoerosion and wildfire can exacerbate warming by releasing large permafrost carbon stocks, and interactions between disturbance regimes can lead to complex ecosystem feedbacks. We conducted geochemical and charcoal analyses of lake sediments from an Alaskan lake to identify thermoerosion and fire events over the past 3,000 years. Thermoerosion was inferred from lake sediments in the context of modern soil data from retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS). Magnetic susceptibility (MS), Ca:K, and Ca:Sr increased with depth in modern RTS soils and were higher on recently exposed than older slump surfaces. Peaks in bulk density, % CaCO3, Ca: K, Ca: Sr, and MS values in the sediments suggest at least 18 thermoerosion events in the Loon Lake watershed over the past 3,000 years. Charcoal analysis identifies 22 fires over the same period at this site. Temporal variability in these records suggests climate-driven responses of both thermoerosion and fire disturbance regimes, with fewer RTS episodes and fire events during the Little Ice Age than the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Moreover, RTS activity lagged behind catchment fires by 20-30 years (> 90% confidence interval), implying that fires facilitated thermoerosion on decadal time scales, possibly because of prolonged active-layer deepening following fire and postfire proliferation of insulative shrub cover. These results highlight the potential for complex interactions between climate, vegetation, and tundra disturbance in response to ongoing warming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,DEC,2017,122,12,,,,,3362,3377,,10.1002/2017JG004027,,,,,,,WOS:000423221300016,,,,,09/09/2020,128,empirical,sediment geochemistry,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We analysed a short lake sediment core from the Yukon Coastal Plain. The age-depth relationship of the core is based on Pb-210/Cs-137 validated by AMS radiocarbon dating. We analysed terrestrial pollen abundances as proxies for regional vegetation development, and we used grain size and biogeochemical analyses (TOC, TN, TOC/TN, C-13) and the analysis of semiaquatic pollen to describe the lake development. Stable abundances of regional pollen taxa between AD 1730 and AD 2012 accompanied by climatic warming indicated that the regional vegetation was not sensitive to climate change. Based on changes in TOC/TN, C-13 and pollen of shallow-water taxa, we reconstructed an increase in lake water depth after AD 1910 that likely followed climatic warming. We attributed this development to climate-driven thaw subsidence in the lake basin.

Here we study this much focused ecosystem state transition in riparian areas, where palatable willows (Salix) are dominant tall shrubs and highly responsive to climate change. For the state transition to take place, small life stages must become tall and abundant. Therefore we predicted that the performance of small life stages (potential recruits) of the tall shrubs were instrumental to the focal transition, where Rangifer managed at high population density would keep the small-stage shrubs in a browse trap independent of summer temperature. We used a large-scale quasi-experimental study design that included real management units that spanned a wide range of Rangifer population densities and summer temperatures in order to assess the relative importance of these two driving variables. Ground surveys provided data on density and height of the small shrub life stages, while the distributional limit (shrubline) of established shrublands (the tall shrub life stage) was derived from aerial photographs. Where Rangifer densities were above a threshold of approximately 5 animals/km(2), we found, in accordance with the expectation of a browse trap, that the small life stages of shrubs in grasslands were at low height and low abundance. At Rangifer densities below this threshold, the small life stages of shrubs were taller and more abundant indicating Rangifer were no longer in control of the grassland state. For the established shrubland state, we found that the shrubline was at a 100-m lower elevation in the management units where Rangifer had been browsing in summer as opposed to the migratory ranges with no browsing in summer. In both seasonal ranges, the shrubline increased 100 m per 1 degrees C increment in temperature. Our study supports the proposal that Rangifer management within a sustainable range of animal densities can mitigate the much-focused transition from grassland to shrubland in a warming Arctic.",,,,"Brathen, Kari Anne/AAN-4666-2020","Stien, Audun/0000-0001-8046-7337; Brathen, Kari Anne/0000-0003-0942-1074",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,DEC,2017,27,8,,,,,2416,2427,,10.1002/eap.1618,,,,,,,WOS:000416862700013,28871616,,,,09/09/2020,131,empirical,shrubline position,recruitment; height; density,"Finnmark, NO",70.5,25.5,vegetation transects; aerial photography,temperature; herbivory,biotic; abiotic,,unknown,landscape,,WOS search

In contrast with previous studies, a recent analysis of faecal pellets and stomach contents of brown lemmings (Lemmus trimucronatus) reported a surprisingly high proportion (34-56%) of willows (Salix spp.) in their diet during both summer and winter in the Canadian high Arctic. To better understand the contribution of willows to the diet of lemmings, we designed a cafeteria experiment to determine which part of Arctic willows (S. arctica), usually the most abundant willow in the Canadian Arctic, were preferred by lemmings. We designed two types of experiments, one with flowering willows (summer stage; n = 10) and one with dormant willows without flowers or leaves (winter stage; n = 11). Lemmings preferred buds and to a lesser extent roots over woody stems in dormant willows, whereas in flowering willows, they preferred flowers and roots over leaves and buds. Our results suggest that lemmings shift their diet seasonally and prefer the fleshiest willow parts, i.e. flowers in summer and buds in winter. High consumption of roots by lemmings in both types of experiments indicates strong underground feeding habits.

Both biomes are characterized by low temperatures and short growing seasons, but they differ in seasonality of solar radiation and in soil water balance due to underlying permafrost in the Arctic. Arcto-alpine plant species are well-adapted to the low temperatures that prevail in their habitats, and plant growth is mainly limited by the availability of nutrients, in particular nitrogen, due to slow mineralization. Nitrogen fixing bacteria are likely important for plant growth in these habitats, but very little is known of these bacteria or forces shaping their communities. In this study, we characterized the potential nitrogen fixing bacterial (PNFB) communities associated with two arcto-alpine pioneer plant species, Oxyria digyna (mountain sorrel) and Saxifraga oppositifolia (blue saxifrage), in three climate regions. Both of these plants readily colonize low nutrient mineral soils. Our goal was to investigate how climate (region) and, on the other hand, host plant and plant species shape these communities. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study describing PNFB communities associated with pioneer plants in different arcto-alpine biomes. Replicate samples were taken from two arctic regions, Kilpisjarvi and Ny-angstrom lesund, and one alpine region, Mayrhofen. In these, the PNFB communities in the bulk and rhizosphere soils and the plant endospheres were characterized by nifH-targeted PCR and massive parallel sequencing. The data revealed strong effects of climatic region on the dominating nitrogen fixers. Specifically, nifH sequences related to Geobacter (delta-Proteobacteria) were present in high relative abundances in the nitrogen-fixing communities in the Mayrhofen and Kilpisjarvi regions, while members of the Clostridiales prevailed in the Kilpisjarvi and Ny-angstrom lesund regions. The bulk and rhizosphere soil as well as the endosphere communities in the Mayrhofen region were all characterized by high relative abundances of nifH sequences related to Geobacter. In contrast, the endosphere and soil (bulk or rhizosphere soil) communities in the High Arctic were highly divergent: endosphere communities in the arctic regions were shaped by Clostridium spp., while nifH sequences representing delta-Proteobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria (in Ny-angstrom lesund), and Verrucomicrobia (in Kilpisjarvi) dominated the soil communities. Interestingly, the major PNFB genera identified in this study have been previously identified as members of conserved core microbiomes in the endospheres and seeds of these plants by 16S rRNA gene based analyses combined with bacterial isolation, suggesting a very tight interaction between diazotrophic bacteria and these arctic pioneer plants. Overall, anaerobic bacterial taxa dominated the PNFB communities of the endospheres and rhizospheres of the two plant species in all study sites.

Plant and microbial processes in these habitats may be susceptible to short-term warming outside the growing season, while the areal cover of barren frost boils has decreased during the past decades due to climate warming-induced shrub expansion. The relative importance of such short-term and long-term climate impacts on carbon (C) dynamics remains unknown. We measured ecosystem CO2 uptake and release (in the field), microbial respiration (in the laboratory), as well as microbial biomass N and soil extractable N in frost boils and the directly adjacent heath in late spring and late summer. These habitats had been experimentally warmed with insulating fleeces from late September until late May for three consecutive years, which allowed us to investigate the direct short-term effects of warming and longer-term, indirect climate effects via vegetation establishment into frost boils. Non-growing season warming increased C uptake at the frost boils in late spring and decreased it in late summer, while the timing and direction of responses was opposite for the heath. Experimental warming had no effects on microbial or ecosystem C release or soil N at either of the habitats. However, C cycling was manifold higher at the heath compared to the frost boils, likely because of a higher SOM stock in the soil. Short-term climate change can thus directly alter ecosystem C uptake at frost-patterned grounds but will most likely not affect microbial C release.

However, landscapescale patterns and drivers of shrub expansion remain poorly understood, inhibiting accurate incorporation of shrub effects into climate models. Here, we use dendroecology to elucidate the role of soil moisture in modifying the relationship between climate and growth for a dominant deciduous shrub, Salix pulchra, on the North Slope of Alaska, USA. We improve upon previous modeling approaches by using ecological theory to guide model selection for the relationship between climate and shrub growth. Finally, we present novel dendroecology-based estimates of shrub biomass change under a future climate regime, made possible by recently developed shrub allometry models. We find that S. pulchra growth has responded positively to mean June temperature over the past 2.5 decades at both a dry upland tundra site and an adjacent mesic riparian site. For the upland site, including a negative second-order term in the climate-growth model significantly improved explanatory power, matching theoretical predictions of diminishing growth returns to increasing temperature. A first-order linear model fit best at the riparian site, indicating consistent growth increases in response to sustained warming, possibly due to lack of temperature-induced moisture limitation in mesic habitats. These contrasting results indicate that S. pulchra in mesic habitats may respond positively to a wider range of temperature increase than S. pulchra in dry habitats. Lastly, we estimate that a 2 degrees C increase in current mean June temperature will yield a 19% increase in aboveground S. pulchra biomass at the upland site and a 36% increase at the riparian site.

However, little is known about drivers of fine-scale temporal changes in understory communities in boreal forests immediately following fire. Knowledge of these changes, and their relationships with burn severity and pre-fire forest stand conditions, could help us determine recovery of forests as wildlife habitat. Such information is urgently needed in the face of climate warming-induced changes in fire frequency and severity. We used a high-quality, long-term dataset of annual measurements of understory vascular plant communities in sub-arctic boreal forest stands dominated by jack pine (Pinus banksiana), black spruce (Picea mariana), or a mix of the two in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Here, we describe the initial 10 years of annual post-fire understory plant community dynamics and assess the important drivers shaping understory composition during this critical period of post-disturbance community assembly. First, we determined the relative importance of burn severity, pre-fire forest type, bare ground, woody debris, and number of years post-fire on understory species richness and composition dynamics following fire. Second, we explored annual dynamics in these communities and determined if compositional change was directional and predictable over time. We found that pre-fire forest type, burn severity, bare ground, woody debris, and number of years post-fire were important predictors of post-fire species richness and composition. Pre-fire forest type explained the greatest variation in understory plant composition, followed by burn severity. Across forest types, most species established within 1-3 years following fire and initial species composition determined directional changes in composition. Our results suggest that targeting monitoring efforts in the years immediately post-fire may be sufficient to understand forest successional direction with respect to composition and the important drivers of those changes over the first decade post-fire. However, the recent and ongoing impacts of climate change in boreal regions of western North America leads to uncertainty surrounding the continued ability of these forests to demonstrate resilience under an altered fire regime so these interactions should continue to be considered across a range of forest types and burn severities.

The often close connection between indigenous peoples and their respective territories allows them to make detailed observations of how these changes transform the landscapes where they practice their daily activities. Here, we report Sami reindeer herders' observations based on their long-term inhabitance and use of contrasting pastoral landscapes in northern Fennoscandia. In particular, we focus on the capacity for various herd management regimes to prevent a potential transformation of open tundra vegetation to shrubland or woodland. Sami herders did not confirm a substantial, rapid, or large-scale transformation of treeless tundra areas into shrub-and/or woodlands. However, where they observe encroachment of open tundra landscapes, a range of factors was deemed responsible. These included abiotic conditions, anthropogenic influences, and the direct and indirect effects of reindeer. The advance of the mountain birch tree line was in some cases associated with reduced or discontinued grazing and firewood cutting, depending on the seasonal significance of these particular areas. Where the tree line has risen in elevation and/or latitude, herding practices have by necessity adapted to these changes. Exploiting the capacity of reindeer impacts on vegetation as a conservation tool offers time-tested adaptive strategies of ecosystem management to counteract a potential encroachment of the tundra by woody plants. However, novel solutions in environmental governance involve difficult trade-offs for ecologically sustainable, economically viable, and socially desirable management strategies.",,,,"Kayhko, Jukka/D-4849-2010; Forbes, Bruce C./L-4431-2013","Kayhko, Jukka/0000-0002-3842-7355; Forbes, Bruce C./0000-0002-4593-5083; Horstkotte, Tim/0000-0003-3951-5370; Utsi, Tove Aagnes/0000-0003-0776-2369",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,SEP,2017,8,9,,,,,,,e01931,10.1002/ecs2.1931,,,,,,,WOS:000410627100012,,,,,09/09/2020,138,poll,vegetation change,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

It is also sensitive to climate change, with increased nitrogen (N) mineralization arising from warmer soils and deeper snow. However, warming also tends to reduce snow cover duration, leading to antagonistic effects of climate change on mineralization. Furthermore, since snow melt is also a trigger for seasonal nutrient pulses, changes to snow melt timing may alter seasonal availability to plants. To investigate the impacts of environmental conditions on ecosystem nutrient availability and seasonal dynamics, we undertook regular, high-frequency measurements of soil extractable and plant N and phosphorus (P) concentrations along with winter and summer N and P mineralization rates along a sub-Arctic catchment representing a gradient in temperature, snow melt timing and vegetation composition. Our data show that a delay in snow melt timing of 11 days did not alter the seasonal dynamics of soil or leaf N and P concentrations. Net N mineralization, however, was highest at the warmest site and at the site with the most productive vegetation, while P was strongly immobilized at all sites, both in winter and summer. N:P ratios suggest that plants were generally P limited at all sites, probably due to strong P immobilization. Our data suggest that where warming and resulting vegetation change increase net N mineralization rates, in combination with strong P immobilization this may impose greater P limitation, possibly limiting the extent to which Arctic ecosystems can increase productivity under warming.",,,,"Koller-France, Eva/W-7415-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,0722-4060,1432-2056,,,,SEP,2017,40,9,,,,,1821,1834,,10.1007/s00300-017-2105-4,,,,,,,WOS:000410258900010,,,,,09/09/2020,139,empirical,nutrient dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Contrary to our expectations, tree line movement was not detected, and there was no increase in willows or shrubby mountain birches, either. Nevertheless, the stability of tundra was apparent. Small-sized, poorly competing arctic species had declined, lichen cover had decreased, and vascular plants, especially evergreen ericoid dwarf shrubs, had gained ground. The novel climate seems to favour competitive clonal species and species thriving in closed vegetation, creating a community hostile for seedling establishment, but equally hostile for many arctic species, too.

However, the observed changes based on remote sensing are the result of multiple environmental drivers, and the effects of individual controls such as warming, herbivory, and other disturbances on changes in vegetation biomass, community structure, and ecosystem function remain unclear. We apply ArcVeg, an arctic tundra vegetation dynamics model, to estimate potential changes in vegetation biomass and net primary production (NPP) at the plant community and functional type levels. ArcVeg is driven by soil nitrogen output from the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, existing densities of Rangifer populations, and projected summer temperature changes by the NCAR CCSM4.0 general circulation model across the Arctic. We quantified the changes in aboveground biomass and NPP resulting from (i) observed herbivory only; (ii) projected climate change only; and (iii) coupled effects of projected climate change and herbivory. We evaluated model outputs of the absolute and relative differences in biomass and NPP by country, bioclimate subzone, and floristic province. Estimated potential biomass increases resulting from temperature increase only are approximately 5% greater than the biomass modeled due to coupled warming and herbivory. Such potential increases are greater in areas currently occupied by large or dense Rangifer herds such as the Nenets-occupied regions in Russia (27% greater vegetation increase without herbivores). In addition, herbivory modulates shifts in plant community structure caused by warming.

Experimental, observational, and socio-ecological research suggests that air temperature-and to a lesser degree precipitation-trends have been the predominant drivers of this change. However, a progressive decoupling of these drivers from Arctic vegetation productivity has been reported, and since 2010, vegetation productivity has also been declining. We created a protocol to (a) identify the suite of controls that may be operating on shrub growth and expansion, and (b) characterise the evidence base for controls on Arctic shrub growth and expansion. We found evidence for a suite of 23 proximal controls that operate directly on shrub growth and expansion; the evidence base focused predominantly on just four controls (air temperature, soil moisture, herbivory, and snow dynamics). 65% of evidence was generated in the warmest tundra climes, while 24% was from only one of 28 floristic sectors. Temporal limitations beyond 10 years existed for most controls, while the use of space-for-time approaches was high, with 14% of the evidence derived via experimental approaches.

Long-term analyses based on dendrochronological techniques applied to shrubs have linked this phenomenon to climate change. However, the multi-stemmed structure of shrubs makes them difficult to sample and therefore leads to non-uniform sampling protocols among shrub ecologists, who will favor either root collars or stems to conduct dendrochronological analyses. Through a comparative study of the use of root collars and stems of Betula glandulosa, a common North American shrub species, we evaluated the relative sensitivity of each plant part to climate variables and assessed whether this sensitivity is consistent across three different types of environments in northwestern Quebec, Canada (terrace, hilltop and snowbed). We found that root collars had greater sensitivity to climate than stems and that these differences were maintained across the three types of environments. Growth at the root collar was best explained by spring precipitation and summer temperature, whereas stem growth showed weak and inconsistent responses to climate variables. Moreover, sensitivity to climate was not consistent among plant parts, as individuals having climate-sensitive root collars did not tend to have climate-sensitive stems. These differences in sensitivity of shrub parts to climate highlight the complexity of resource allocation in multi-stemmed plants. Whereas stem initiation and growth are driven by microenvironmental variables such as light availability and competition, root collars integrate the growth of all plant parts instead, rendering them less affected by mechanisms such as competition and more responsive to signals of global change. Although further investigations are required to determine the degree to which these findings are generalizable across the tundra biome, our results indicate that consistency and caution in the choice of plant parts are a key consideration for the success of future dendroclimatological studies on shrubs.",,,,"Myers-Smith, Isla H/D-1529-2013","Myers-Smith, Isla H/0000-0002-8417-6112",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,AUG,2017,23,8,,,,,3281,3291,,10.1111/gcb.13631,,,,,,,WOS:000404863300027,28107770,,,,09/09/2020,143,empirical,shrub growth,growth,"Northwestern Quebec, CA",57.75,-76.333,dendrochronology,temperature; precipitation,abiotic,Betula glandulosa,1,species,,WOS search

We hypothesize that, being more coupled to ground microclimate, junipers will be less influenced by atmospheric conditions and will less respond to the post-1950 climate warming than coexisting standing trees. Unexpectedly, shrub and tree growth forms revealed divergent growth trends in all the three biomes, with juniper performing better than trees at Mediterranean than at Polar and Alpine sites. The post-1980s decline of tree growth in Mediterranean sites might be induced by drought stress amplified by climate warming and did not affect junipers.

Despite observations of the heightened sensitivity of these systems to change, there has not been a comprehensive assessment of factors that drive ecosystem changes throughout Alaska. Here we present research that improves our understanding of the main drivers of the spatiotemporal patterns of carbon dynamics using in situ observations, remote sensing data, and an array of modeling techniques. In the last 60 yr, Alaska has seen a large increase in mean annual air temperature (1.7 degrees C), with the greatest warming occurring over winter and spring. Warming trends are projected to continue throughout the 21st century and will likely result in landscape-level changes to ecosystem structure and function. Wetlands, mainly bogs and fens, which are currently estimated to cover 12.5% of the landscape, strongly influence exchange of methane between Alaska's ecosystems and the atmosphere and are expected to be affected by thawing permafrost and shifts in hydrology. Simulations suggest the current proportion of near-surface (within 1 m) and deep (within 5 m) permafrost extent will be reduced by 9-74% and 33-55% by the end of the 21st century, respectively. Since 2000, an average of 678 595 ha/yr was burned, more than twice the annual average during 1950-1999. The largest increase in fire activity is projected for the boreal forest, which could result in a reduction in late-successional spruce forest (8-44%) and an increase in early-successional deciduous forest (25-113%) that would mediate future fire activity and weaken permafrost stability in the region. Climate warming will also affect vegetation communities across arctic regions, where the coverage of deciduous forest could increase (223-620%), shrub tundra may increase (4-21%), and graminoid tundra might decrease (10-24%). This study sheds light on the sensitivity of Alaska's ecosystems to change that has the potential to significantly affect local and regional carbon balance, but more research is needed to improve estimates of land-surface and subsurface properties, and to better account for ecosystem dynamics affected by a myriad of biophysical factors and interactions.",,,,"JAFAROV, ELCHIN/G-1616-2016","JAFAROV, ELCHIN/0000-0002-8310-3261",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,JUL,2017,27,5,,,,,1383,1402,,10.1002/eap.1538,,,,,,,WOS:000405174300001,28390104,,,,09/09/2020,145,modelling,carbon dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We experimentally advanced snowmelt in two contrasting plant community types (heath and meadow) in northern Sweden and measured above- and below-ground phenology (leaf-out, flowering and fine root growth). We expected earlier snowmelt to advance both above- and below-ground phenology, and shrub-dominated heath to be more responsive than meadow. 3. Snow melted on average 9 days earlier in the manipulated plots than in controls, and soil temperatures were on average 0.9 degrees C higher during the snowmelt period of 3 weeks. This resulted in small advances in above-ground phenology, but contrary to our expectations, root phenology was unresponsive, with root growth generally starting before leaf-out. These responses to the snowmelt treatment were similar in both plant community types, despite strong differences in dominating plant functional types and root properties, such as root length and turnover. 4. The lack of a response in root phenology, despite warmer soil temperatures and above-ground phenological advances, adds evidence that above-ground plant responses might not be directly translated to below-ground plant responses, and that our understanding of factors driving below-ground phenology is still limited, although of major importance for water, nutrient and carbon cycling.",,,,"Milbau, Ann/AAF-3022-2020; Jansson, Roland/B-7972-2013","Jansson, Roland/0000-0003-1767-7010; Milbau, Ann/0000-0003-3555-8883; Blume-Werry, Gesche/0000-0003-0909-670X",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,JUL,2017,31,7,,,,,1493,1502,,10.1111/1365-2435.12853,,,,,,,WOS:000404860200014,,,,,09/09/2020,146,empirical,root phenology,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Although climatically driven increases in wildfire frequency and extent have been hypothesized to increase vegetation transitions from tundra to boreal forest, fire reduces mycorrhizal inoculum. Therefore, changes in mycobiont inoculum may potentially limit tree-seedling establishment beyond current treeline. We investigated whether ectomycorrhizal shrubs that resprout after fire support similar fungal taxa to those that associate with tree seedlings that establish naturally after fire. We then assessed whether mycobiont identity correlates with the biomass or nutrient status of these tree seedlings. The majority of fungal taxa observed on shrub and seedling root systems were EMF, with some dark septate endophytes and ericoid mycorrhizal taxa. Seedlings and adjacent shrubs associated with similar arrays of fungal taxa, and there were strong correlations between the structure of seedling and shrub fungal communities. These results show that resprouting postfire shrubs support fungal taxa compatible with tree seedlings that establish after wildfire. Shrub taxon, distance to the nearest shrub and fire severity influenced the similarity between seedling and shrub fungal communities. Fungal composition was correlated with both foliar C:N ratio and seedling biomass and was one of the strongest explanatory variables predicting seedling biomass. While correlative, these results suggest that mycobionts are important to nutrient acquisition and biomass accrual of naturally establishing tree seedlings at treeline and that mycobiont taxa shared by resprouting postfire vegetation may be a significant source of inoculum for tree-seedling establishment beyond current treeline.",,,,"Taylor, Lee/V-1921-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,JUL,2017,26,14,,,,,3826,3838,,10.1111/mec.14143,,,,,,,WOS:000404618000020,28401610,,,,09/09/2020,147,empirical,fungal community structure,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Mountain ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate warming since their biota is generally limited by low temperatures. Cryptogams such as lichens and bryophytes are important for the biodiversity and functioning of these ecosystems, but have not often been incorporated in vegetation resurvey studies. Hence, we lack a good understanding of how vascular plants, lichens and bryophytes respond interactively to climate warming in alpine communities. Here we quantified long-term changes in species richness, cover, composition and thermophilization (i.e. the increasing dominance of warm-adapted species) of vascular plants, lichens and bryophytes on four summits at Dovrefjell, Norway. These summits are situated along an elevational gradient from the low alpine to high alpine zone and were surveyed for all species in 2001, 2008 and 2015. During the 15-year period, a decline in lichen richness and increase in bryophyte richness was detected, whereas no change in vascular plant richness was found. Dwarf-shrub abundance progressively increased at the expense of lichens, and thermophilization was most pronounced for vascular plants, but occurred only on the lowest summits and northern aspects. Lichens showed less thermophilization and, for the bryophytes, no significant thermophilization was found. Although recent climate change may have primarily caused the observed changes in vegetation, combined effects with non-climatic factors (e.g. grazing and trampling) are likely important as well.

Tall-shrub expansion into low-statured communities, a hallmark of recent vegetative change across tundra ecosystems, involves three major genera: Alnus, Betula and Salix. Which genus expands most into tundra landscapes will determine ecosystem properties. 2. We show that Alnus and Salix shrubs segregate thermal space (elevation 9 insolation) and colonize tundra landscapes differently in response to climate warming, thereby replacing different tundra types. 3. Vegetative change estimated from repeat photography should account for hill-slope. Methodologically, slope determines surface area estimated from orthophotos as projected pixel area times secant of pixel slope. Ecologically, the change in thermally responsive vegetative area is sensitive to terrain steepness, scaling as the cosecant of hill-slope, so that studies should expect more shrub expansion in areas of shallow slopes than steep slopes. 4. Repeat aerial photography in Alaska's Chugach Mountains from 1972 to 2012 orthorectified on a high-resolution lidar digital elevation model indicated tall Salix was rare in 1972 and colonized warmer slopes by 2012. Tall Alnus colonized steeper, cooler slopes both by 2012 and by 1972. Salix and forest colonized similar thermal space. Colonization probability for both shrub genera was maximized at intermediate elevations. 5. Alnus colonization adjacent to dwarf-shrub tundra was twenty times as likely as Salix colonization. Salix colonization adjacent to low-shrub/herbaceous tundra was three times as likely as Alnus colonization. Replacement of dwarf-shrub tundra by Alnus and of low-shrub/herbaceous communities by Salix will affect herbivores and soil properties. 6. Good agreement between observations of plant functional type and multinomial predictions in a thermal space defined by elevation and insolation suggested that these two variables were sufficient for forecast modelling. Spatially explicit, climate-driven generalized linear multinomial and random forest classification models in available thermal space forecast surface areas of forest, Alnus, Salix and tundra over a range of warming, modelled as upward shifted isotherms, including expected IPCC scenarios. Both modelling approaches indicated that shrubs may respond nonlinearly to warming. 7. Synthesis.

The Alaska National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 was the first 30-m resolution baseline land cover product of the entire state derived from circa 2001 Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary data. We developed a comprehensive approach named AKUP11 to update Alaska NLCD from 2001 to 2011 and provide a 10-year cyclical update of the state's land cover and land cover changes. Our method is designed to characterize the main land cover changes associated with different drivers, including the conversion of forests to shrub and grassland primarily as a result of wildland fire and forest harvest, the vegetation successional processes after disturbance, and changes of surface water extent and glacier ice/snow associated with weather and climate changes. For natural vegetated areas, a component named AKUP11-VEG was developed for updating the land cover that involves four major steps: 1) identify the disturbed and successional areas using Landsat images and ancillary datasets; 2) update the land cover status for these areas using a SKILL model (System of Knowledge-based Integrated -trajectory Land cover Labeling); 3) perform decision tree classification; and 4) develop a final land cover and land cover change product through the postprocessing modeling. For water and ice/snow areas, another component named AKUP11-WIS was developed for initial land cover change detection, removal of the terrain shadow effects, and exclusion of ephemeral snow changes using a 3-year MODIS snow extent dataset from 2010 to 2012. The overall approach was tested in three pilot study areas in Alaska, with each area consisting of four Landsat image footprints. The results from the pilot study show that the overall accuracy in detecting change and no-change is 90% and the overall accuracy of the updated land cover label for 2011 is 86%. The method provided a robust, consistent, and efficient means for capturing major disturbance events and updating land cover for Alaska. The method has subsequently been applied to generate the land cover and land cover change products for the entire state of Alaska. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In 24 study sites, we collected aboveground biomass and raw litter. Biomass was sorted into functional groups (shrubs, graminoids, forbs, bryophytes, lichens), which, in turn, were separated into photosynthetic and structural compartments. We characterized community structure in terms of biomass allocation of functional groups, estimated leaf primary production and litter persistence, and performed analyses of variance for each of the factors considered. Our results showed that community structure is driven mainly by the functional type of the dominant species, although abiotic factors are also relevant. Production depends on abiotic conditions. It is constrained by low temperatures in northern exposures and by low water availability in permeable bedrock types. Litter decomposition depends on environmental conditions and the dominant species characteristics.

The data presented show that vegetation on drained lake basins in OCF is characterized by two distinct assemblages: tall willow stands and sedge swards. Field sampling indicates that these alternative successional trajectories result from variation in soil moisture following drainage. Increased willow mortality on older drained basins suggests that intraspecific competition drives self-thinning in shrub thickets. This finding, combined with data from paleoecological studies and contemporary vegetation in OCF, suggests that willow stands on drained lake basins are seral communities.

I argue that assisted colonization may have negative consequences in arctic-alpine and boreal regions. The observed slow movement of plants toward the north has been an argument for assisted colonization. However, these range shifts may be slow because for many plants microclimatic warming (ignored by advocates of assisted colonization) has been smaller than macroclimatic warming. Arctic-alpine and boreal plants may have limited possibilities to disperse farther north or to higher elevations. I suggest that arctic-alpine species are more likely to be driven to extinction because of competitive exclusion by southern species than by increasing temperatures. If so, the future existence of arctic-alpine and boreal flora may depend on delaying or preventing the migration of plants toward the north to allow northern species to evolve to survive in a warmer climate. In the arctic-alpine region, preventing the dispersal of trees and shrubs may be the most important method to mitigate the negative effects of climate change.

As a common non-biological stress, the freeze-thaw process can substantially alter soil carbon and nitrogen cycles. However, a comprehensive understanding of nutrient pools and dynamics in response to freeze-thaw cycles is not available. Here, we evaluated the effect sizes of the responses of 18 variables related to soil carbon and nitrogen cycles to the freeze-thaw effect from 46 papers. Seventeen studies that reported field observations and 28 studies that reported results from laboratory experiments were included, as well as one paper that used both methods to explore freeze-thaw processes. We used a random-effects model to examine whether soil origins, effect phases (including initial and long-term effects), methods and soil horizons affect the magnitudes of the responses to freeze-thaw events. The soil sources include forest, shrubland, grassland/meadow, cropland, tundra and wetland. We used meta regression to explore possible relationships among effect sizes with freezing temperature, soil pH, soil C/N ratios and other factors. Our results suggest that the freeze-thaw process causes microbial N and the microbial C/N ratio to decrease by 12.2% and 8.5%, respectively. Soil solution dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) are enhanced by 27.5% and 373%, respectively. The freeze thaw effect increases the concentrations of NHS4+, NOT and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) by 84.1%, 29.6% and 35.4%, respectively. N2O emissions are also increased by 95.0% in freeze-thaw treatments. Laboratory measurements resulted in contrasting responses in terms of mineralization, nitrification and respiration. Freeze-thaw events promote turnover of fine roots but have no effect on the long-term aboveground biomass of grassland and heath. The results of this meta-analysis help to achieve a better understanding of the overall effects of freeze-thaw events on soil carbon and nitrogen cycles and their modulation across different environments.

A better understanding of habitat requirements is needed to accurately predict the response of herbivore communities to shrub expansion. We examined patterns of browsing by moose (Alces alces), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus, L. muta) across the tundra of northern Alaska to determine whether forage requirements explain the distribution of herbivores in this ecosystem. In addition, we examined the potential for competition among these three shrub-dependent species. We recorded shrub characteristics and browsing levels at 59 sites along a 568 km riparian transect spanning from the Brooks Range to the Arctic Coast. Mean shrub height was positively correlated with browsing intensity for all three species (r = 0.40-0.71). The minimum shrub height threshold for hare occurrence (>= 87 cm, 95% CI: 67-94) was similar to that for moose (>= 81 cm, 95% CI: 65-96), whereas ptarmigan were nearly ubiquitous (>= 3 cm, lower 95% CI = 0). Diet overlap among herbivores was nearly complete, with all three species heavily browsing feltleaf willow (Salix alaxensis).

Such land cover changes feed back to climate and permafrost thaw through altering the surface energy budget. We quantified the influence of vegetation type, canopy characteristics, and patchiness on the tundra shortwave radiation components. We used in situ measurements and vegetation mapping to parametrise a 3D radiative transfer model (DART) for summer conditions at the Kytalyk test site in northeast Siberia. We analysed model results assessing the most important drivers of canopy albedo, transmittance, and absorptance of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Tundra albedo was strongly influenced by the fractional cover of water surfaces. Albedo decreased with increasing shrub cover. However, plant area index effects on albedo were not statistically significant. Canopy transmittance and PAR absorptance (f(ApAR)) were almost entirely controlled by plant area index at the landscape scale. Only about one half of the total plant area index consisted of green leaves, while wood and standing dead leaves contributed equally to the other half. While spatial patterns and patch sizes of vegetation types and open water did not significantly influence the radiation budget at the landscape scale, it contributed to the large variability at the local scale. Such local variability of shortwave radiation may impact evapotranspiration and primary productivity at a range of scales. Therefore, the variation of radiation fluxes within single vegetation types potentially affects larger scale energy, water, and carbon fluxes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, whereas most studies focus on single factors in isolation, mainly due to interrelation and correlation among drivers complicating interpretation and analyses, there are still only few studies on how multiple ecosystems respond to climate related factors at the same time. Here, we use a hierarchical Bayesian model with a bioenergetic predatorprey framework to study how different climatic factors affect trophic interactions and production in small Arctic lakes. Natural variation in temperature and catchment land-cover was used as a natural experiment to exemplify how interactions between and production of primary producers (phytoplankton) and grazers (zooplankton) are driven by direct (temperature) and indirect (catchment vegetation) factors, as well as the presence or absence of apex predators (fish). The results show that increased vegetation cover increased phytoplankton growth rate by mediating lake nutrient concentration. At the same time, increased temperature also increased grazing rates by zooplankton. Presence of fish increased zooplankton mortality rates, thus reducing grazing. The Arctic is currently experiencing an increase in both temperature and shrub vegetation cover due to climate change, a trend, which is likely to continue. Our results point towards a possible future general weakening of zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton and greening of arctic lakes with increasing temperatures.

We found no evidence of a negative effect of caribou abundance on vegetation biomass. On the contrary, we found a strong bottom-up effect in which a warmer climate related to diminishing sea ice has increased the plant biomass on the summer pastures, along with a paradoxical decline in caribou populations. This result suggests that this climate-induced greening has been accompanied by a deterioration of pasture quality. The shrub expansion in Arctic North America involves plant species with strong antibrowsing defenses.

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a source of topographic information which can be linked to local growing conditions. Here, we investigated the effect of DEM derived variables, namely elevation, topographic position, radiation and wetness on AGB and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in a Fennoscandian forest-alpine tundra ecotone. Boosted regression trees were used to derive non-parametric response curves and relative influences of the explanatory variables. Elevation and potential incoming solar radiation were the most important explanatory variables for both AGB and NDVI. In the NDVI models, the response curves were smooth compared with AGB models. This might be caused by large contribution of field and shrub layer to NDVI, especially at the treeline. Furthermore, radiation and elevation had a significant interaction, showing that the highest NDVI and biomass values are found from low-elevation, high-radiation sites, typically on the south-southwest facing valley slopes. Topographic wetness had minor influence on AGB and NDVI. Topographic position had generally weak effects on AGB and NDVI, although protected topographic position seemed to be more favorable below the treeline. The explanatory power of the topographic variables, particularly elevation and radiation demonstrates that DEM-derived land surface parameters can be used for exploring biomass distribution resulting from landform control on local growing conditions.

We found a high rate of Larch forest recruitment in sites of moderate burn severity, while a more severe burn was the preferable condition for quick occupation by vegetation that included early seral communities of shrubs, grasses, conifers and broadleaf trees. Sites close to water and that received higher solar energy during the summer months showed a higher rate of both recovery types, defined by the FRI and FVC, dependent on burn severity.

A late snowmelt and start of growing season is counterbalanced by a fast greenup and a tendency to higher peak greenness values. Snow water equivalents and soil moisture explained up to 77% of growing season duration and senescence phase, highlighting thatwater availability is a prominent driver in the heath site, rather than temperatures. We found a significant advance in the start of spring by 10 days and in the end of fall by 11 days, resulting in an unchanged growing season length. Vegetation greenness, derived from the imagery, was correlated to primary productivity, showing that the imagery holds valuable information on vegetation productivity.",,,,"Schmidt, Niels Martin/G-3843-2011; Hansen, Birger/E-5192-2015; Lund, Magnus/J-4922-2013","Schmidt, Niels Martin/0000-0002-4166-6218; Hansen, Birger/0000-0002-5440-6925; Lund, Magnus/0000-0003-1622-2305; Westergaard-Nielsen, Andreas/0000-0003-1021-0530",,,,,,,,,,,,0044-7447,1654-7209,,,,FEB,2017,46,,,1,SI,,S39,S52,,10.1007/s13280-016-0864-8,,,,,,,WOS:000395124900005,28116683,,,,09/09/2020,163,empirical,tundra phenology,phenology,"Zackenberg, GL",74.467,-20.567,repeat photography,snow cover; soil moisture; temperature,abiotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

We investigated the nesting biology and nest habitat characteristics of Smith's Longspurs (Calcarius pictus) in 2 study areas in the Brooks Range of Alaska, USA. First, we examined variation in nesting phenology in relation to local temperatures. We then characterized nesting habitat and analyzed nest-site selection for a subset of nests (n = 86) in comparison with paired random points. Finally, we estimated the daily survival rate of 257 nests found in 2007-2013 with respect to both habitat characteristics and weather variables. Nest initiation was delayed in years with snow events, heavy rain, and freezing temperatures early in the breeding season. Nests were typically found in open, low-shrub tundra, and never among tall shrubs (mean shrub height at nests = 26.8 +/- 6.7 cm). We observed weak nest-site selection patterns. Considering the similarity between nest sites and paired random points, coupled with the unique social mating system of Smith's Longspurs, we suggest that habitat selection may occur at the neighborhood scale and not at the nest-site scale. The best approximating model explaining nest survival suggested a positive relationship with the numbers of days above 21 degrees C that an individual nest experienced; there was little support for models containing habitat variables. The daily nest survival rate was high (0.972-0.982) compared with that of most passerines in forested or grassland habitats, but similar to that of passerines nesting on tundra. Considering their high nesting success and ability to delay nest initiation during inclement weather, Smith's Longspurs may be resilient to predicted changes in weather regimes on the breeding grounds. Thus, the greatest threat to breeding Smith's Longspurs associated with climate change may be the loss of low-shrub habitat types, which could significantly change the characteristics of breeding areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0010-5422,1938-5129,,,,FEB,2017,119,1,,,,,85,97,,10.1650/CONDOR-16-87.1,,,,,,,WOS:000395115000008,,,,,09/09/2020,164,empirical,bird nesting patterns,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search
J,"McMahon, S; Schimel, JP",,,,"McMahon, Shawna; Schimel, Joshua P.",,,Shifting patterns microbial N-metabolism across seasons in upland Alaskan tundra soils,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the arctic tundra, N controls the productivity and composition of tundra plant communities. In the Alaskan tundra, microbes only ever appear to be N-limited in Eriophorum vaginatum-dominated tussock tundra, and that only during the summer growing season; during winter microbes continue to respire but show no evidence of N-limitation. What drives the shifts in microbial N-limitation and how are they developed by the metabolic pathways involved in processing available soil organic compounds? To answer these questions, we collected soils from tussock and shrub tundra during four seasons and incubated them with C-13-labeled glucose, glutamate, and protein; then we measured C-13 in CO2, microbial biomass, and specific phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). By analyzing C-13-PLFAs, we were able to assess whether different groups of microbes processed the substrates differently, and to assess changes in N-use brought on by the Arctic winter. Monomers were metabolized during both seasons. In tussock tundra, glutamate-C was assimilated into PLFAs more extensively in winter than summer, suggesting glutamate was used as a C-source during winter but as a N-source during summer. In shrub soils, the flow of C from glutamate to PLFAs tracked with glucose year-round suggesting that the communities were primarily using glutamate as a C source. These results parallel biogeochemical evidence showing shifts in N availability and limitation. Protein metabolism was negligible in winter in soils other than tussocks. In summer, protein was broken down and all communities incorporated C; however, fungi did not assimilate protein-C at all while Gram-positive bacteria appeared to be proteolytic specialists. The different patterns of metabolism of C vs. N containing compounds across microbial groups regulate the dynamics of both soil. communities and of soil carbon and nitrogen in tundra soils. As such, the flow of C-13 into different biomarker PLFAs provided a lens to evaluate the shifting dynamics of microbial communities and of the resource environment in which they find themselves.

Evidence suggests that legacies are likely to be evident across meters to hundreds of kilometers and for decades, centuries, and millennia.

The mainland regions with the highest numbers of naturalized aliens are some Australian states (with New South Wales being the richest on this continent) and several North American regions (of which California with 1753 naturalized plant species represents the world's richest region in terms of naturalized alien vascular plants). England, Japan, New Zealand and the Hawaiian archipelago harbour most naturalized plants among islands or island groups. These regions also form the main hotspots of the regional levels of naturalization, measured as the percentage of naturalized aliens in the total flora of the region. Such hotspots of relative naturalized species richness appear on both the western and eastern coasts of North America, in north-western Europe, South Africa, south-eastern Australia, New Zealand, and India. High levels of island invasions by naturalized plants are concentrated in the Pacific, but also occur on individual islands across all oceans. The numbers of naturalized species are closely correlated with those of native species, with a stronger correlation and steeper increase for islands than mainland regions, indicating a greater vulnerability of islands to invasion by species that become successfully naturalized. South Africa, India, California, Cuba, Florida, Queensland and Japan have the highest numbers of invasive species. Regions in temperate and tropical zonobiomes harbour in total 9036 and 6774 naturalized species, respectively, followed by 3280 species naturalized in the Mediterranean zonobiome, 3057 in the subtropical zonobiome and 321 in the Arctic. The New World is richer in naturalized alien plants, with 9905 species compared to 7923 recorded in the Old World. While isolation is the key factor driving the level of naturalization on islands, zonobiomes differing in climatic regimes, and socioeconomy represented by per capita GDP, are central for mainland regions. The 11 most widely distributed species each occur in regions covering about one third of the globe or more in terms of the number of regions where they are naturalized and at least 35% of the Earth's land surface in terms of those regions' areas, with the most widely distributed species Sonchus oleraceus occuring in 48% of the regions that cover 42% of the world area. Other widely distributed species are Ricinus communis, Oxalis corniculata, Portulaca oleracea, Eleusine indica, Chenopodium album, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Stellaria media, Bidens pilosa, Datura stramonium and Echinochloa crus-galli. Using the occurrence as invasive rather than only naturalized yields a different ranking, with Lantana camara (120 regions out of 349 for which data on invasive status are known), Calotropis procera (118), Eichhornia crassipes (113), Sonchus oleraceus (108) and Leucaena leucocephala (103) on top. As to the life-history spectra, islands harbour more naturalized woody species (34.4%) than mainland regions (29.5%), and fewer annual herbs (18.7% compared to 22.3%). Ranking families by their absolute numbers of naturalized species reveals that Compositae (1343 species), Poaceae (1267) and Leguminosae (1189) contribute most to the global naturalized alien flora. Some families are disproportionally represented by naturalized aliens on islands (Arecaceae, Araceae, Acanthaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae, Convolvulaceae, Rubiaceae, Malvaceae), and much fewer so on mainland (e.g. Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Boraginaceae). Relating the numbers of naturalized species in a family to its total global richness shows that some of the large species-rich families are over-represented among naturalized aliens (e.g. Poaceae, Leguminosae, Rosaceae, Amaranthaceae, Pinaceae), some under-represented (e.g. Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae), whereas the one richest in naturalized species, Compositae, reaches a value expected from its global species richness. Significant phylogenetic signal indicates that families with an increased potential of their species to naturalize are not distributed randomly on the evolutionary tree. Solanum (112 species), Euphorbia (108) and Carex (106) are the genera richest in terms of naturalized species; over-represented on islands are Cotoneaster, Juncus, Eucalyptus, Salix, Hypericum, Geranium and Persicaria, while those relatively richer in naturalized species on the mainland are Atriplex, Opuntia, Oenothera, Artemisia, Vicia, Galium and Rosa. The data presented in this paper also point to where information is lacking and set priorities for future data collection.

Given its importance across various contexts and scales, it is vital to understand the drivers of contemporary patterns in phytomass and primary productivity to improve predictions under altered environmental conditions. Here, we analysed local patterns in above-ground phytomass, calorific energy contents, and primary productivity as important pasture resources in a complex arcticalpine landscape along pronounced micro-topographical and elevational gradients. Using data from 110 sampling sites, of which 38 were equipped with on-site recordings of soil moisture and near-surface temperatures, we asked how the observed patterns in pasture resources are related to the environment and whether commonly used structural proxies or physiologically relevant, functional data were better suited for their explanation. Using partial least squares regression based on a set of structural plus functional explanatory variables, the latter revealed to be the best determinants. Our results suggest how the ecological mechanisms behind contemporary pasture resources and, likewise, the arctic-alpine greening are interactively driven by the near-surface thermal regime, associated snow coverage, and soil moisture availability. Moreover, they reveal an obvious decoupling of near-surface processes from the overall atmospheric and topographic constraints which are commonly used as proxies. We conclude that estimates of current and future pasture resources would be significantly improved if fine-scaled, functional data, rather than structural data, could be used. However, this implies further effort in providing such data, since appropriate regionalization techniques are still lacking.",,,,"Pape, Roland/L-6753-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,0435-3676,1468-0459,,,,,2017,99,4,,,,,353,370,,10.1080/04353676.2017.1368833,,,,,,,WOS:000423268800004,,,,,09/09/2020,168,empirical,alpine pasture productivity,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

This requires recruitment from seed, which currently shows very low rates in arctic regions, where long-lived and vegetatively reproducing plants dominate. Therefore, we pose the question whether recruitment (germination and seedling establishment) in arctic regions will significantly improve in a warmer world, and thus allow species to follow their climatic niche. We used a full factorial experiment to examine if realistic warmer temperatures (+3 degrees C; infrared radiation) and increased nitrogen availability (+1.4 g N m(-2) year(-1)) affected germination, seedling survival and above-and below-ground seedling biomass in five species common in subarctic regions (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Betula nana, Pinus sylvestris, Solidago virgaurea, Vaccinium myrtillus). We found that warming increased seedling emergence in all species, but that subsequent mortality also increased, resulting in no net warming effect on seedling establishment. Warming slightly increased above-ground seedling biomass. Fertilization, on the other hand, did not influence seedling biomass, but it increased seedling establishment in B. nana while it reduced establishment in V. myrtillus. This may help B. nana dominate over V. myrtillus in warmer tundra. Surprisingly, no interactive effects between warming and fertilization were found. The lack of a general positive response of seedling establishment to warmer and more nutrient-rich conditions suggests that (sub) arctic species may experience difficulties in tracking their climatic niche. Predictions of future species distributions in arctic regions solely based on abiotic factors may therefore overestimate species' ranges due to their poor establishment. Also, the opposite response to fertilization of two key (sub) arctic dwarf shrubs, i.e. B. nana and V. myrtillus, could have important implications for the future development of arctic plant communities and argues for more research into the role of fertilization for plant establishment.",,,,"Milbau, Ann/AAF-3022-2020","Nijs, Ivan/0000-0003-3111-680X; Milbau, Ann/0000-0003-3555-8883",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-2851,,,,,,2017,9,,,,,,,,plx040,10.1093/aobpla/plx040,,,,,,,WOS:000416367000007,29026511,,,,09/09/2020,169,empirical,seedling establishment,recruitment,"Abisko, SE",86.35,18.817,transplant experiment,temperature; soil N concentration,,Betula nana; Vaccinium myrtillus,2,species,,WOS search

In boreal Alaska, the conventional forest management paradigm has focused on the production of large-dimension timber, particularly white spruce (Picea glauca). However, energy generation and heating from wood is increasing, and is likely to significantly expand total forest harvest, further shifting management focus to fuelwood production. We evaluated the effects of forest harvest management practices on post-harvest regeneration by examining whether harvest type, site preparation method, and reforestation technique resulted in differences in forest regeneration in terms of species presence, dominance, basal area, and total stem biomass using a stochastic gradient boosting (TreeNet algorithm). We recorded diameter at breast height and height of white spruce, birch (Betula neoalaskana), and aspen (Populus tremuloides) in 726 plots from 30 harvest units, distributed across the various harvest and treatment types, harvest years, harvest sizes, and geographical locations. Our results indicate that management practices suitable/acceptable for woody biomass production differ from the more traditional dimensional timber production from white spruce-focused management. Artificial reforestation does not differ from natural regeneration in obtaining more stems or producing greater biomass. Clearcutting and site preparation increased tree regeneration, basal area, and woody biomass when compared to a partial harvest with no site preparation. Planting of white spruce in the Alaskan boreal forest may only be necessary in some specific circumstances, such as years with no/low white spruce seed crop, or in landscapes depleted of seed trees.",,,,,"Young, Brian/0000-0003-1852-3275",,,,,,,,,,,,1999-4907,,,,,JAN,2017,8,1,,,,,,,12,10.3390/f8010012,,,,,,,WOS:000395506900011,,,,,09/09/2020,170,empirical,forest succession dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Winter is a period of dormancy for plants of cold environments. However, winter climate is changing, leading to an increasing frequency of stochastic warm periods (winter warming events) and concomitant reductions in snow cover. These conditions can break dormancy for some plants and expose them to freeze-and-thaw stress. Mosses are a major component of high-latitude ecosystems, yet the longer-term impacts of such winter warming events on mosses remain unknown. 2. In order to determine the longer-term legacy effects of winter warming events on mosses, we undertook a simulation of these events over three consecutive winters in a sub-Arctic dwarf shrub-dominated open woodland. The mat-forming feather moss, Hylocomium splendens (the most abundant cryptogam in this system), is one of the most widespread Arctic and boreal mosses and plays a key functional role in ecosystems. We studied the ecophysiological performance of this moss during the summers of the experimental period (2007-2009) and in the following years (2010-2013). 3. We show that the previously reported warming-induced reduction in segment growth and photosynthesis during the experimental years was persistent. Four years after the last event, photosynthesis and segment growth were still 30 and 36% lower than control levels, which was only a slight improvement from 44 and 43% 4 years earlier. Winter warming did not affect segment symmetry. During the years after the last simulated event, in both warmed and control plots, chlorophyll fluorescence and segment growth, but not net photosynthesis, increased slightly. The increases were probably driven by increased summer rainfall over the study years, highlighting the sensitivity of this moss to rainfall change. 4. Overall, the legacy effects shown here demonstrate that this widespread and important moss is likely to be significantly disadvantaged in a future sub-Arctic climate where frequent winter warming events may become the norm. Given the key importance of mosses for soil insulation, shelter and carbon sequestration in high-latitude regions, such persistent impacts may ultimately affect important ecosystem functions.",,,,"Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014; Bokhorst, Stef/D-1858-2009","Bjerke, Jarle/0000-0003-2721-1492",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,JAN,2017,31,1,,,,,127,134,,10.1111/1365-2435.12703,,,,,,,WOS:000394372700014,,,,,09/09/2020,171,empirical,moss physiology,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

At Bylot Island (73 degrees N, 80 degrees W) in the Canadian high Arctic where bushes of willows (Salix richardsonii Hook) are growing, we have observed the snow stratigraphy and measured the vertical profiles of snow density, thermal conductivity and specific surface area (SSA) in over 20 sites of high Arctic tundra and in willow bushes 20 to 40 cm high. We find that shrubs increase snow height, but only up to their own height. In shrubs, snow density, thermal conductivity and SSA are all significantly lower than on herb tundra. In shrubs, depth hoar which has a low thermal conductivity was observed to grow up to shrub height, while on herb tundra, depth hoar only developed to 5 to 10 cm high. The thermal resistance of the snowpack was in general higher in shrubs than on herb tundra. More signs of melting were observed in shrubs, presumably because stems absorb radiation and provide hotspots that initiate melting. When melting was extensive, thermal conductivity was increased and thermal resistance was reduced, counteracting the observed effect of shrubs in the absence of melting. Simulations of the effect of shrubs on snow properties and on the ground thermal regime were made with the Crocus snow physics model and the ISBA (Interactions between Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere) land surface scheme, driven by in situ and reanalysis meteorological data. These simulations did not take into account the summer impact of shrubs. They predict that the ground at 5 cm depth at Bylot Island during the 2014-2015 winter would be up to 13 degrees C warmer in the presence of shrubs. Such warming may however be mitigated by summer effects.",,,,"Morin, Samuel/E-8005-2011","Morin, Samuel/0000-0002-1781-687X",,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,DEC 12,2016,13,23,,,,,6471,6486,,10.5194/bg-13-6471-2016,,,,,,,WOS:000391123800001,,,,,09/09/2020,173,empirical,snow cover patterns,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Increased shrub cover generally lowers surface albedo, which results in higher energy absorption and further warming. In parts of Fennoscandia, herbivory is known to control vegetation height and abundance, and thus preventing this positive feedback. Here, we combine field measurements of albedo, herbivory and vegetation characteristics in four topographically-defined vegetation types of varying shrub height and abundance with land surface modeling (JULES) to investigate if reindeer grazing can influence the energy balance of an arctic tundra. We find that when reindeer reduces shrub height and abundance, summer albedo increases in both Betula nana-dominated heath vegetation and Salix glauca-dominated willow depressions. Model results reveal associated lower net radiation, and latent and sensible heat fluxes in heavily-grazed sites in all shrub-dominated vegetation types. Our results also suggest that the structural shift from graminoid to shrub tundra drives the difference in summer albedo, rather than shifts from dwarf-shrub to tall-shrub tundra. Reindeer has thus a potential cooling effect on climate by increasing summer albedo and decreasing net radiation, which highlights the importance of mammalian herbivores for the earth system beyond their local grazing impacts. However, the strong effects of reindeer on albedo are probably restricted to areas with high reindeer densities, since a dramatic vegetation change is essential. The importance of these processes across the whole range of reindeer densities found in the arctic tundra needs to be further evaluated.",,,,"Olofsson, Johan/A-9362-2009; Menard, Cecile B./F-7860-2014; Sitters, Judith/AAJ-7256-2020","Menard, Cecile B./0000-0003-2166-9523; Sitters, Judith/0000-0003-2926-5339",,,,,,,,,,,,1748-9326,,,,,DEC,2016,11,12,,,,,,,125013,10.1088/1748-9326/aa5128,,,,,,,WOS:000391723000001,,,,,09/09/2020,174,empirical,tundra energy balance,albedo; abundance,"Troms, NO",69.5,27.5,remote sensing; vegetation surveys; herbivore monitoring,herbivory; vegetation type,biotic; abiotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

M.; Berendse, Frank",,,"Potential Arctic tundra vegetation shifts in response to changing temperature, precipitation and permafrost thaw",BIOGEOSCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Over the past decades, vegetation and climate have changed significantly in the Arctic. Deciduous shrub cover is often assumed to expand in tundra landscapes, but more frequent abrupt permafrost thaw resulting in formation of thaw ponds could lead to vegetation shifts towards graminoid-dominated wetland. Which factors drive vegetation changes in the tundra ecosystem are still not sufficiently clear. In this study, the dynamic tundra vegetation model, NUCOM-tundra (NUtrient and COMpetition), was used to evaluate the consequences of climate change scenarios of warming and increasing precipitation for future tundra vegetation change. The model includes three plant functional types (moss, graminoids and shrubs), carbon and nitrogen cycling, water and permafrost dynamics and a simple thaw pond module. Climate scenario simulations were performed for 16 combinations of temperature and precipitation increases in five vegetation types representing a gradient from dry shrub-dominated to moist mixed and wet graminoid-dominated sites. Vegetation composition dynamics in currently mixed vegetation sites were dependent on both temperature and precipitation changes, with warming favouring shrub dominance and increased precipitation favouring graminoid abundance. Climate change simulations based on greenhouse gas emission scenarios in which temperature and precipitation increases were combined showed increases in biomass of both graminoids and shrubs, with graminoids increasing in abundance. The simulations suggest that shrub growth can be limited by very wet soil conditions and low nutrient supply, whereas graminoids have the advantage of being able to grow in a wide range of soil moisture conditions and have access to nutrients in deeper soil layers. Abrupt permafrost thaw initiating thaw pond formation led to complete domination of graminoids. However, due to increased drainage, shrubs could profit from such changes in adjacent areas. Both climate and thaw pond formation simulations suggest that a wetter tundra can be responsible for local shrub decline instead of shrub expansion.",,,,"Pullens, Johannes/L-2135-2019","Pullens, Johannes/0000-0003-4581-6444; van der Kolk, Henk-Jan/0000-0002-8023-379X; Heijmans, Monique/0000-0002-6036-4039",,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,NOV 18,2016,13,22,,,,,6229,6245,,10.5194/bg-13-6229-2016,,,,,,,WOS:000388695100002,,,,,09/09/2020,175,modelling,community composition,abundance,,,,modelling,temperature; nutrient cycling; precipitation; thaw pond abundance,abiotic,,,,,WOS search

Early-successional nitrogen (N)-fixing plants are widely thought to facilitate productivity and vegetation development on N-poor sites, thus accounting for observed vegetation patterns later in succession. We tested this facilitative impact on vegetation development in a 23-yr field experiment on an Interior Alaska (USA) floodplain. On three replicate early-successional silt bars, we planted late-successional white spruce (Picea glauca) seedlings in the presence and absence of planted seedlings of an early-successional N-fixing shrub, thinleaf alder (Alnus incana). Alder initially facilitated survivorship and growth of white spruce. Within six years, however, after canopy closure, alder negatively affected spruce survivorship and growth. Our three replicate sites followed different successional trajectories. One site was eliminated by erosion and supported no vegetation development during our study. The other two sites, which differed in site moisture, diverged in vegetation composition. Structural equation modeling (SEM) suggested that, in the drier of these two sites, alder inhibited spruce growth directly (presumably by competition) and indirectly through effects mediated by competition with other woody species. However, at the wetter site, alder had both positive and negative effects on spruce growth, with negative effects predominating. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in alder thickets further reduced height growth of spruce in the wetter site. We conclude that net effects of alder on white spruce, the late-successional dominant, were primarily inhibitory and indirect, with the mechanisms depending on initial site moisture. Our results highlight the importance of long-term research showing that small differences among initial replicate sites can cause divergence in successional trajectories, consistent with individualistic distributions of species and communities along environmental gradients. This divergence was detectable only decades later.",,,,"Johnstone, Jill/C-9204-2009","Johnstone, Jill/0000-0001-6131-9339",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,NOV,2016,97,11,,,,,2986,2997,,10.1002/ecy.1529,,,,,,,WOS:000387228200010,27870053,,,,09/09/2020,176,empirical,tree seedling performance,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

To determine the potential influence of factors other than deepened snow that are associated with taller, denser shrubs, we also compared shrub growth between low birch hummock and tall birch-dominated tundra. Neither deciduous shrub above- nor belowground production nor nitrogen accumulation was enhanced by deepened snow. However, deciduous birch shrub new shoot production was 23x larger and total vascular shoot to belowground biomass ratios were higher in the tall birch tundra than the birch hummock (similar to 0.7 and similar to 0.4, respectively), indicating that the combination of deeper snow together with other internal feedbacks greatly enhanced birch growth.

In the case of woody roots, it has been reported that mechanical stress induces an asymmetric distribution of lateral roots and reaction wood formation, but the mechanisms underlying these responses are largely unknown. In the present work, the hypothesis was tested that bending could determine an asymmetric response in the two sides of the main root axis as cells are stretched on the convex side and compressed on the concave side. Methods Woody taproots of 20 seedlings were bent to an angle of 90 degrees using a steel net. Changes in the anatomy, lignin and phytohormone content and proteome expression in the two sides of the bent root were analysed; anatomical changes, including dissimilarities and similarities to those found in poplar bent woody stem, were also considered. Key Results Compression forces at the concave side of poplar root induced the formation of reaction wood which presented a high lignin content and was associated with the induction of cambium cell activity. Auxin seemed to be the main hormone triggering lignin deposition and cell wall strengthening in the concave sides. Abscisic acid appeared to function in the water stress response induced by xylem structures and/or osmotic alterations in the compression sides, whereas gibberellins may control cell elongation and gravitropisms. Conclusions Poplar root reaction wood showed characteristics different from those produced in bent stem. Besides providing biomechanical functions, a bent root ensures water uptake and transport in the deforming condition induced by tension and compression forces by two different strategies: an increase in xylem thickness in the compressed side, and lateral root formation in the tension side.",,,,"Montagnoli, Antonio/V-1724-2019; CHIATANTE, DONATO/B-8783-2015","CHIATANTE, DONATO/0000-0003-4854-5408; De Zio, Elena/0000-0002-5696-922X; Terzaghi, Mattia/0000-0002-8803-7726; Trupiano, Dalila/0000-0002-3907-2816; Scaloni, Andrea/0000-0001-9362-8515",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,OCT,2016,118,4,,,SI,,865,883,,10.1093/aob/mcw159,,,,,,,WOS:000386487600026,27558889,,,,09/09/2020,178,empirical,root anatomy,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In this study, our goal was to use airborne lidar and imagery to build accurate high -resolution shrub biomass maps for an important research landscape in the American Arctic. In a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis, optimized lidar-derived canopy volume was a good single predictor of harvested shrub biomass (R-2 = 0.62; RMSD = 219 g m(-2); slope = 1.08). However, model accuracy was improved by incorporating additional lidar-derived canopy metrics and airborne spectral metrics in a Random Forest regression approach (pseudo R-2 = 0.71; RMSD = 197 g m(-2): slope = 1.02). The best Random Forest model was used to map shrub biomass at 0.80 m resolution across three lidar collection footprints (similar to 12.5 km(2) total) near Toolik Field Station on Alaska's North Slope. We characterized model uncertainty by creating corresponding maps of the coefficient of variation in Random Forest shrub biomass estimates. We also explore potential benefits of incorporating lidar-derived topographic metrics, and consider tradeoffs inherent in employing different data sources for high -resolution vegetation mapping efforts.

However, the effect of different vegetation types on the retention of fine aeolian sediment is poorly understood. We investigated this phenomenon, using the retention of fine, pyroclastic material (tephra) from the 2011 eruption of the Grimsvotn volcano, Iceland, as a case study. We set out to quantify structural variation in different vegetation types and to relate structural metrics to the thickness of recently deposited volcanic ash layers in the sedimentary section. We utilised a combination of vegetation and soil surveys, along with photogrammetric analysis of vegetation structure. We found that indices of plant community composition were a poor proxy for vegetation structure and were largely unrelated to tephra thickness. However, structural metrics, derived from photogrammetric analysis, were clearly related to variations in tephra layer thickness at a landscape scale and tephra layers under shrub patches were significantly thicker than those outside the shrub canopy. We therefore concluded that: a) vegetation cover was a critical factor in the retention of fine aeolian sediment for deposit depths up to few centimetres; b) structural variation in vegetation cover played a major role in determining the configuration of tephra deposits in the sedimentary section. These findings have implications for the analysis of ancient volcanic eruptions and archaeological/palaeoenvironmental reconstructions based on the interpretation of tephra deposits.

How has the composition, cover and canopy height of three High Arctic plant communities responded to 18 yr of experimental warming? To what extent can hand-held remote sensing methods serve as a proxy for community structure in tundra ecosystems? Location: Alexandra Fiord lowland, Ellesmere Island, Canada. Methods: We experimentally-warmed patches of tundra using the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) open-top chambers to simulate climate change. We measured differences in community structure after 18 yr of experimental warming in three distinct plant communities: a wet sedge meadow, a mesic evergreen shrub-dominated community and a dry deciduous shrub dominated community. We measured plant cover, height and growth form composition using a point-intercept method and investigated the use of handheld NDVI at the plot scale as a proxy for plant community structure. Results: All three plant communities showed unique differences after longterm experimental warming. Both the meadow and evergreen shrub communities had significant differences in community composition between control and warmed plots, but none of the communities showed differences in plant cover or height. Deciduous shrubs and bryophytes were more abundant in warmed over control plots at both the evergreen shrub and.meadow communities. Warmed plots in the meadow community had fewer graminoid.s and lower height values. Lichen was consistently less abundant in warmed plots across all communities where it occurred, NDVI values were driven by deciduous shrubs, and graminoids and showed con:tin-unity-specific correlations with plant cover, Conclusions: Our results suggest community-level resistance to warming in terms of plant cover and height, but compositional differences support the hypothesis that climate change responses will be corninunity-specilic.

Here, we ask whether the input of marine subsidies in tundra systems would cause spatial variation in the strength of rodent-plant interactions between coastal areas, where predators have access to marine-derived resources, and non-subsidized inland areas of northern Fennoscandia. We present a detailed evaluation of predator-rodent-vegetation interactions along a coast-inland gradient, during the 2011 rodent outbreak and the two following decline years, by using direct assessments of rodent impacts and tracing of marine-derived nutrients in the food web. Our results revealed that the main rodent predator during summer, the long-tailed jaeger Stercorarius longicaudus, did not benefit from marine resources while breeding (relative dietary proportion in chicks' diet = 0-3%). Contrary to this pattern, parasitic jaegers S. parasiticus, bred exclusively near the coast and preyed effectively on both marine resources (41% of chicks' diet) and rodents (12%). Mammalian predators also showed a higher activity during winter near the coast. Despite overall higher predator numbers, no evidence was found for lower rodent population growth rates during the three monitoring summers and for weaker rodent grazing impacts in the coastal area. Instead, we documented pronounced damages caused by lemmings and voles on bryophytes and vascular plants, especially dwarf shrubs (e.g. Vaccinum myrtillus) all along the coast-inland gradient. Taken together, our results did not support the hypothesis that marine subsidies would trigger a trophic cascade in coastal tundra areas of northern Fennoscandia during a major rodent outbreak, probably due to a relatively low diversity of marine-subsidized predators in the region.

Millennial-scale pollen studies of the sediments that accumulated during the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene (ca. 2.7 to 2.5 Ma) demonstrate orbitally-driven vegetation and climate changes during this transitional interval. Pollen spectra show a significant vegetation shift at the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary that is, however, delayed by a few thousand years compared to lacustrine response. About 2.70-2.68 Ma the vegetation at Lake El'gygytgyn, currently a tundra area was mostly dominated by larch forests with some shrub pine, shrub alder and dwarf birch in understory. During the marine isotope stages G3 and G1, ca. 2.665-2.647 and 2.625-2.617 Ma, some spruce trees grew in the local larch -pine forests, pointing to relatively warm climate conditions. At the beginning of the Pleistocene, around 2.588 Ma, a prominent climatic deterioration led to a change from larch-dominated forests to predominantly treeless steppe- and tundra-like habitats. Between ca. 2.56-2.53 Ma some climate amelioration is reflected by the higher presence of coniferous taxa (mostly pine and larch, but probably also spruce) in the area. After 2.53 Ma a relatively cold and dry climate became dominant again, leading to open steppe-like and shrubby environments followed by climate amelioration between ca. 2.510 and 2.495 Ma, when pollen assemblages show that larch forests with dwarf birch and shrub alder still grew in the lake's vicinity.

Deeper snow keeps the arctic soils warmer and alters soil attributes and vegetation, e.g., increase in nitrogen availability, expansion of shrubs and decline in shade-intolerant lichens and bryophytes. Changes in soil properties and vegetation are expected to influence on saprotrophic and plant-symbiotic fungi, but how increased snow depth affects their community composition remain unknown. In the present work, we used DNA meta-barcoding to study the effects of long-term experimental manipulations of snow depth on soil fungal communities in dry heath and moist tussock tundra in Arctic Alaska. We report strong changes in fungal community compositions in the two tundra types, with pronounced declines observed in the majority of fungal. functional guilds, including ectomycorrhizal, lichenized, plant pathogenic, saprotrophic and bryophyte-associated species. The observed changes in lichenized and bryophyte-associated fungi are in agreement with previously published above-ground changes, i.e. decrease of lichen and bryophyte cover and diversity. However, the majority of observed trends, including the decline of ectomycorrhizal fungi (that were anticipated to benefit from the expansion of their host plants), suggest that changes in fungal communities do not entirely correspond to and are not primarily driven by shifts in vegetation. Instead, arctic fungal communities appear to exhibit faster turnover that may be influenced by dynamic interactions with numerous biotic and abiotic factors, e.g., soil nutrient cycling and community dynamics in other groups of soil microorganisms. We highlight the importance of below-ground studies in assessing ecosystem responses to climatic changes, because faster turnover of microbial communities may be applicable for monitoring early-stage alterations caused by climatic changes.

Examining C & nitrogen (N) accumulation rates over decades to centuries may provide additional understanding of the dominant mechanisms for their storage, which can be masked by seasonal and interannual variability when investigated over the short term. We examined longer-term accumulation rates, using Pb-210 and C-14 to date soil layers, for a wide variety of boreal ecosystems: a black spruce forest, a shrub ecosystem, a tussock grass ecosystem, a sedge-dominated ecosystem, and a rich fen. All ecosystems had similar decadal C accumulation rates, averaging 84 +/- 42 gCm(-2) yr(-1). Long-term (century) C accumulation rates were slower than decadal rates, averaging 14 +/- 5 gCm(-2) yr(-1) for all ecosystems except the rich fen, for which the long-term C accumulation rates was more similar to decadal rates (44 +/- 5 and 76 +/- 9 gCm(-2) yr(-1), respectively). The rich fen also had the highest long-term N accumulation rates (2.7 gNm(-2) yr(-1)). The lowest N accumulation rate, on both a decadal and long-term basis, was found in the black spruce forest (0.2 and 1.4 gNm(-2) yr(-1), respectively). Our results suggest that the controls on long-term C and N cycling at the rich fen is fundamentally different from the other ecosystems, likely due to differences in the predominant drivers of nutrient cycling (oxygen availability, for C) and reduced amounts of disturbance by fire (for C and N). This result implies that most shifts in ecosystem vegetation across the boreal region, driven by either climate or succession, will not significantly impact regional C or N dynamics over years to decades. However, ecosystem transitions to or from a rich fen will promote significant shifts in soil C and N storage.",,,,,"Fuller, Christopher/0000-0002-2354-8074; Harden, Jennifer W/0000-0002-6570-8259",,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,AUG 1,2016,13,15,,,,,4315,4327,,10.5194/bg-13-4315-2016,,,,,,,WOS:000382827700001,,,,,09/09/2020,186,empirical,nutrient dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We sampled dwarf birch (Betula nana L.) at a northeastern Siberian tundra site and used dendrochronological methods to explore the relationship between climatic variables and local shrub dominance. We found that establishment of shrub ramets was positively related to summer precipitation, which implies that the current high dominance of B. nana at our study site could be related to high summer precipitation in the period from 1960 to 1990. The results confirmed that early summer temperature is most influential to annual growth rates of B. nana. In addition, summer precipitation stimulated shrub growth in years with warm summers, suggesting that B. nana growth may be co-limited by summer moisture supply.

However, while taller shrub communities are expanding, dwarf shrub communities show reductions under climate warming, and the mechanisms driving the latter (such as warming temperatures or accelerated spring snowmelt) may be complex. To determine and disentangle the response of a widespread arctic-alpine prostrate dwarf shrub to both climate warming and changes in snowmelt time, we investigated phenology, clonal and sexual reproduction, leaf size, wood tissue carbon balance and leaf damage in 480 patches of Salix herbacea, along its elevational and snowmelt microhabitat range over 3years in a space-for-time substitution. Earlier snowmelt was associated with longer phenological development periods, an increased likelihood of herbivory and fungal damage, lower stem density, smaller leaves and lower end-of-season wood reserve carbohydrates. Furthermore, while early snowmelt was associated with an increased proportion of flowering stems, the proportion of fruiting stems was not, as fruit set decreased significantly with earlier snowmelt. Warmer temperatures at lower elevations were associated with lower stem numbers and larger leaves.Synthesis. Our study indicates that phenology, fitness proxies and fungal/insect damage of the dwarf shrub S.herbacea are strongly influenced by snowmelt timing, and that earlier spring snowmelt reduced performance in S.herbacea. The likely mechanisms for many of the observed patterns are related to adverse temperature conditions in the early growing season. Reductions in clonal (stem number) and sexual reproduction (reduced fruit set) under earlier snowmelt, in addition to increasing damage probability, will likely lead to lower fitness and poorer performance, particularly in shrubs growing in early-exposure microhabitats. Further, we saw few concurrent benefits of higher temperatures for S.herbacea, particularly as warming was associated with lower clonal growth. As growing seasons become warmer and longer in arctic and alpine tundra ecosystems, early snowmelt is a critical mechanism reducing fitness and performance in a widespread dwarf shrub and may ultimately reduce dwarf shrub communities in tundra biomes.",,,,"Bossdorf, Oliver/A-8328-2008; Wipf, Sonja/A-5075-2010; Hoch, Guenter/H-1505-2018","Bossdorf, Oliver/0000-0001-7504-6511; Wipf, Sonja/0000-0002-3492-1399; Hoch, Guenter/0000-0003-0985-9746; Cortes, Andres J./0000-0003-4178-0675; Rixen, Christian/0000-0002-2486-9988; van Kleunen, Mark/0000-0002-2861-3701",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,JUL,2016,104,4,,,,,1041,1050,,10.1111/1365-2745.12579,,,,,,,WOS:000379015400016,,,,,09/09/2020,188,empirical,shrub performance,phenology; reproduction; leaf size; C balance; herbivory,"Davos, CH",46.8,9.8,monitoring,elevation; snowmelt date,abiotic,Salix herbacea,1,species,,WOS search

However, a great deal of uncertainty remains concerning how ecosystem functioning may be affected by interactions between warming and other drivers, such as plant functional group composition and environmental context. In this study, we investigated how vascular plant litter decomposition and nutrient release were affected by experimental warming, moss removal and shrub removal along a post-fire boreal forest successional gradient. Our results show that litter decomposition and nutrient loss were primarily driven by understory plant functional group removal. The removal of mosses generally reduced litter mass loss and increased litter phosphorus (P) loss, while shrub removal typically increased litter mass loss and in one litter species reduced immobilization of P. Litter nitrogen (N) loss was unaffected by plant functional group removal. Warming interacted with successional stage and species identity of the litter decomposed, but these effects were uncommon and generally weak. As climate change advances, moss cover is expected to decrease, while shrub cover is expected to increase. Taken together with our results, this suggests that lower moss cover will decrease leaf litter decomposition rates and increase P release from litter, while increasing shrub cover will decrease decomposition rates and may reduce P release from litter. Our results demonstrate that in the short term, the direct effects of warming and successional stage will play a relatively minor role in driving litter decomposition processes in the boreal forest. In the long term, as the climate warms, temperature and its indirect effects via changes in the understory vegetation will play an important role in driving litter decomposition, thereby potentially altering C storage and nutrient cycling.

The frozen mummy of the Yukagir Bison found in northern Yakutia, Russia represents the most complete specimen of this species in the world. It belongs to a young, 4.1-4.5 year old male, which dates back about 10,500 cal BP. The analyses revealed that the overall size of this specimen was comparable to a 6-year old European and American bison. Its horn spread falls within the upper limits of B. bison athabascae and B. bison bison males, as well as within the average sizes of B. priscus occidentalis from East Siberia and North America. While most of the not fully-grown Yukagir Bison body size fell within the average parameters of both grown modern species, the body and hind foot lengths were closer to the lower limits of the European bison. The color and hair pattern appeared to be close to the Blue Babe mummy (B. priscus) and modern Wood bison (modern morphotype of B. bison athabascae) and European (B. bonasus) bison. The geological age of the Yukagir Bison, along with the data from other specimens indicate that this species, which survived the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, became rare but was still widely distributed in the northern part of centraleastern Siberia until about 8000 years ago. The juxtaposed data from arctic latitude sediments and the Bison priscus stomach content pollen indicate that it was selective grazer in the environment dominated by unfavorable shrub and forest-tundra vegetation. The scarce Holocene steppe bison remains in Eastern Siberia reflects the dramatic decrease of suitable habitats and pastures during the early Holocene climatic optimum in the high Arctic, which was a major factor of irreversible population fragmentation and decline leading to the species' extinction.

Rapid warming across northern biomes threatens to accelerate rates of peatland ecosystem respiration. Despite compensatory increases in net primary production, greater ecosystem respiration could signal the release of ancient, century- to millennia-old carbon from the peatland organic matter stock. Warming has already been shown to promote ancient peatland carbon release, but, despite the key role of vegetation in carbon dynamics, little is known about how plants influence the source of peatland ecosystem respiration. Here, we address this issue using insitu(14)C measurements of ecosystem respiration on an established peatland warming and vegetation manipulation experiment. Results show that warming of approximately 1 degrees C promotes respiration of ancient peatland carbon (up to 2100years old) when dwarf-shrubs or graminoids are present, an effect not observed when only bryophytes are present. We demonstrate that warming likely promotes ancient peatland carbon release via its control over organic inputs from vascular plants. Our findings suggest that dwarf-shrubs and graminoids prime microbial decomposition of previously locked-up' organic matter from potentially deep in the peat profile, facilitating liberation of ancient carbon as CO2. Furthermore, such plant-induced peat respiration could contribute up to 40% of ecosystem CO2 emissions. If consistent across other subarctic and arctic ecosystems, this represents a considerable fraction of ecosystem respiration that is currently not acknowledged by global carbon cycle models. Ultimately, greater contribution of ancient carbon to ecosystem respiration may signal the loss of a previously stable peatland carbon pool, creating potential feedbacks to future climate change.",,,,"Ostle, Nicholas J/E-4847-2014; Garnett, Mark H/C-2377-2009; Oakley, Simon/K-1857-2013","Ostle, Nicholas J/0000-0003-3263-3702; Garnett, Mark H/0000-0001-6486-2126; Oakley, Simon/0000-0002-5757-7420; Walker, Tom/0000-0001-8095-6026",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,MAY,2016,22,5,,,,,1880,1889,,10.1111/gcb.13213,,,,,,,WOS:000373130700016,26730448,,,,09/09/2020,191,empirical,ecosystem respiration,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

The best examples of Younger Dryas moraines are found in the Central Pyrenees, involving short ice tongues up to 4 km in length in the highest massifs (above 3000 m a.s.l.) of the southern versant. Small cirque glaciers and rock glaciers formed during the YD occurred in other Pyrenean massifs, in the Cantabrian Range and in the Gredos and Guadarrama sierras (Central Range), as indicated by several rocky, polished thresholds that were ice-free at the beginning of the Holocene. Although some former rock glaciers were re-activated during the Younger Dryas, glacial activity was limited in the southernmost part of the Iberian Peninsula (Sierra Nevada). Most Iberian records show vegetation changes during the YD characterized by a forest decline and an expansion of shrubs (mainly Juniperus) and steppe herbs, although the vegetation response was not homogeneous because of variable resilience among ecosystems. Available records also document a variable lake response in terms of hydrology and productivity, with a decrease in sedimentation rates and organic productivity in most high altitude lakes and increases in salinity and relatively lower lake levels at lower altitudes. The impact of the Younger Dryas on the coastal environment was almost negligible, but it was responsible for a brief cessation in sea level rise. High-resolution analyses of new speleothem records have documented a double structure for the YD with an earlier drier phase followed by a relatively more humid period. The review of geomorphological evidence demonstrates a strong latitudinal control of glacial activity during the YD, with more intense development in the northern than in the southern regions. The increase in humidity during the second phase of the YD in southern latitudes could have been a decisive factor for glacier advance in the northern Iberian mountains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Disturbances can have particularly large effects on high-latitude ecosystems when ecosystem structure and function is controlled by strong feedbacks between soil conditions, vegetation, and ground thermal regime. In this study we investigated the impact of road construction and maintenance on vegetation structure and biomass along the Dempster Highway where it crosses the Peel Plateau in the Northwest Territories. To explore drivers of tall shrub proliferation and to quantify shrub proliferation in this region of continuous permafrost, greyscale air photos (1975) and Quickbird satellite imagery (2008) were used to map landcover change within two 0.6 km(2) belts next to the road and two 0.6 km(2) belts 500 m away from the road. Maps showing areas where: 1) tall shrubs expanded, and 2) dwarf shrub tundra resisted invasion were then used to select field sites where a suite of biophysical variables were measured. Rapid tall shrub proliferation and greater biomass adjacent to the road indicate that disturbance can facilitate vegetation change in tundra environments. Our field data also suggests that increased shrub proliferation adjacent to the road was caused by greater soil moisture. Tall shrub proliferation adjacent to the road occurred at lower elevation sites characterized by wetter soils with thicker organic layers.

However, the impacts can vary depending on the species or taxa examined, suggesting that the influences of interactions on species distributions and diversity are not always straightforward and can be taxon-contingent. The aim of this study was therefore to examine how the importance of biotic interactions varies within a community. We incorporated three biotic predictors (cover of the dominant vascular species) into two correlative species richness modelling frameworks to predict spatial variation in the number of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens in arctic-alpine Fennoscandia, in N Europe. In addition, predictions based on single-species distribution models were used to determine the nature of the impact (negative vs. positive outcome) of the three dominant species on individual vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen species. Our results suggest that biotic variables can be as important as abiotic variables, but their relative contributions in explaining the richness of sub-dominant species vary among dominant species, species group and the modelling framework implemented. Similarly, the impacts of biotic interactions on individual species varied among the three species groups and dominant species, with the observed patterns partly reflecting species' biogeographic range.

However, we lack a complete understanding of how physiological differences between deciduous shrubs and coexisting species may confer competitive advantages to shrubs. We combined leaf gas exchange and stable isotope analyses of two important species, Betula nana and Poa pratensis, to elucidate the processes governing seasonal carbon (C) gain in West Greenland. We tested two competing hypotheses. On one hand, we anticipated the cooler, drier soils beneath the Betula canopy could result in greater drought sensitivity in this species. Alternatively, because Poa tends to occupy sites with wetter soils, we hypothesized that it may be more sensitive to drought. Our results revealed greater drought sensitivity in Poa, which displayed reductions in A(max) and g(s) during periods of high atmospheric demand and dry soils. Additionally, leaf Delta C-13 and Delta O-18 were negatively correlated in Poa, suggesting strong stomatal influence on Delta C-13. Conversely, there was no relationship between gs and canopy or soil microclimates and no correlation between leaf Delta C-13 and Delta O-18 in Betula, indicating that variation in Delta C-13 may have been driven by variation in photosynthesis. Our results suggest that Poa is more susceptible to drought than Betula, whereas Betula was able to maintain steady, yet conservative, C gain.

Our analysis indicated that 29.4% and 2.9% of the land area of Canada and Alaska showed statistically significant positive (greening) and negative (browning) trends respectively, at significance level p < 0.01, after burned forest areas were masked out. The area with greening trend dominated over that with browning trend for all land cover types. The greening occurred primarily in the tundra of western Alaska, along the north coast of Canada and in northeastern Canada; the most intensive and extensive greening occurred in Quebec and Labrador. The browning occurred mostly in the boreal forests of eastern Alaska. The Landsat-based greenness trend is broadly similar to the 8-km GIMMS AVHRR-based trend for all vegetation zones. However, for tundra, the Landsat data indicated much less extensive greening in Alaska North Slope and much more extensive greening in Quebec and Labrador, and substantially less extensive browning trend in the boreal forests that were free of fire disturbances. These differences call for further validation of the Landsat reflectance and the AVHRR NDVI datasets. Correlation study with local environmental factors, such as topography, glacial history and soil condition, will be needed to understand the heterogeneous greenness change at the Landsat scale.

However, climate change is predicted to increase nutrient availability leading to increases in carbon sequestration and shifts in community structure to more productive species. Despite tight coupling of productivity with canopy nutrients at the vegetation scale, it remains unknown how species/shoot level foliar nutrients couple to growth, or how climate change may influence foliar nutrients-productivity relationships to drive changes in ecosystem carbon gain and community structure. We investigated the influence of climate change on arctic plant growth relationships to shoot level foliar N and phosphorus (P) in three dominant subarctic dwarf shrubs using an 18-year warming and nutrient addition experiment. We found a tight coupling between total leaf N and P per shoot, leaf area and shoot extension. Furthermore, a steeper shoot length-leaf N relationship in deciduous species (Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium uliginosum) under warming manipulations suggests a greater capacity for nitrogen to stimulate growth under warmer conditions in these species. This mechanism may help drive the considerable increases in deciduous shrub cover observed already in some arctic regions. Overall, our work provides the first evidence at the shoot level of tight coupling between foliar N and P, leaf area and growth i.e. consistent across species, and provides mechanistic insight into how interspecific differences in alleviation of nutrient limitation will alter community structure and primary productivity in a warmer Arctic.",,,,"Koller-France, Eva/W-7415-2019; Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014","Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107",,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,MAR,2016,19,2,,,,,326,338,,10.1007/s10021-015-9936-z,,,,,,,WOS:000371797400008,,,,,09/09/2020,197,empirical,shrub nutrient concentrations and growth,growth; leaf nutrient concentrations,"Abisko, SE",68.35,18.817,nutrient analysis; shoot length measurements,temperature; nutrient addition,abiotic,Empetrum nigrum; Vaccinium uliginosum; Vaccinium myrtillus,3,species,,WOS search

However, little is known about how warming interacts with other ecosystem drivers, such as plant functional groups or changes associated with succession, to affect the soil community and thereby alter ecosystem functioning. We investigated how experimental warming and the removal of plant functional groups along a post-fire boreal forest successional gradient impacted soil microbial and nematode communities. Our results showed that warming altered soil microbial communities and favored bacterial-based microbial communities, but these effects were mediated by mosses and shrubs, and often varied with successional stage. Meanwhile, the nematode community was generally unaffected by warming and was positively affected by the presence of mosses and shrubs, with these effects mostly independent of successional stage. These results highlight that different groups of soil organisms may respond dissimilarly to interactions between warming and changes to plant functional groups, with likely consequences for ecosystem functioning that may vary with successional stage. Due to the ubiquitous presence of shrubs and mosses in boreal forests, the effects observed in this study are likely to be significant over a large proportion of the terrestrial land surface.

Their small population sizes and the impacts of global changes are limiting factors in the conservation of this threatened subspecies. An effective conservation policy requires precise basic knowledge of a species' food and habitat requirements, information that is practically non-existent for this Pyrenean population. Here, we describe the diet of a ptarmigan population in the Eastern Pyrenees, the environmental factors influencing its variability and the relationship between diet floristic composition and quality. Diet composition was determined by microhistological analysis of faeces and diet quality was estimated from free-urate faecal N content. Our results show that grouse diet is based mainly on arctic-alpine shrubs of the Ericaceae family, as well as dwarf willows (Salix spp.) and Dryas octopetala. The most frequently consumed plant species was Rhododendron ferrugineum, but its abundance in the diet was negatively related to the diet nitrogen content. Conversely, the abundance of Salix spp., grass leaves and arthropods increased the nitrogen content of the diet. Seasonality associated with snow-melting contributed the most to variability in the Pyrenean ptarmigan diet, differentiating winter from spring/summer diets. The latter was characterised by a high consumption of dwarf willows, flowers, arthropods and tender forb leaves. Geographic area and sex-age class influenced diet variability to a lesser extent. Current temperature increases in the Pyrenees due to global warming may reduce the persistence and surface area of snow-packs where preferred plants for rock ptarmigan usually grow, thus reducing food availability. The high consumption of Rh. ferrugineum characterised the diet of the Pyrenean population.

The main aim of the study was to develop a tree-ring chronology of polar willow (Salix polaris Wahlenb.) from southwest Spitsbergen, attempt to explain its extreme pointer years (extremely low value of growth-ring widths) and to demonstrate the dendrochronological potential of this species. This plant is a deciduous, prostrate, creeping dwarf shrub that produces anatomically distinct annual growth rings with the consistent ring width variation. After using serial sectioning we developed rigorously cross-dated ring width chronology covering the period 1951-2011. Since the beginning of the 1980s an increase of the mean and maximum growth ring width has been observed which is consistent with the increase of both temperature and precipitation in the Arctic reported from meteorological sources. Nine negative extreme years were distinguished and explained by complex hydroclimatic drivers, which highlight the importance of availability of moisture from snowpack and spring precipitation. An additional negative factor present in the years with very low dwarf shrubs growth is rapid thawing and fast freezing during winter as well as low sunshine duration.

Using two techniques, we quantified the magnitudes, relative proportions and environmental drivers of R (H) and R (A) in four common arctic vegetation types in West Greenland. We employed a trenching method in large patches of Betula nana, Salix glauca, mixed-shrub (equal mix of Betula and Salix) and graminoids dominated by Poa spp. At a nearby location, we introduced (CO2)-C-13 to Betula- and graminoid-dominated plots. The difference in the autotrophic proportion (R (A)/R (S)) between methods was minimal, providing confidence that our more extensive trenching approach provided accurate estimates of R (A) and R (H). Despite contrasting microclimate conditions, large differences in vegetation structure and wide variation in R (S), there were minimal differences in mean R (A)/R (S) (0.40-0.48 across all vegetation types).

Here we use growth data from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key functional traits-wood density, specific leaf area and maximum height-consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies(5). Competition within species was stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak benefit for maximum height.

In this study, we measured S. arctica reproductive effort, early establishment, survival and growth in the Zackenberg valley, north-east Greenland. We sampled four plant communities that varied with respect to snow conditions, soil moisture, nutrient content and plant composition. We found large variability in reproductive effort and success with total catkin density ranging from 0.6 to 66 catkins/m(2) and seedling density from <1 to 101 seedlings/m(2). There were also major differences in crown area increment (4-23 cm(2)/year) and stem radial growth (40-74 mu m/year). The snowbed community, which experienced a recent reduction in snow cover, supported young populations with high reproductive effort, establishment and growth. Soil nutrient content and herbivore activity apparently did not strongly constrain plant reproduction and growth, but competition by Cassiope tetragona and low soil moisture may inhibit performance.

These changes feed back to permafrost and climate. Permafrost can be protected by soil shading through vegetation as it reduces the amount of solar energy available for thawing. Regional climate can be affected by a reduction in surface albedo as more energy is available for atmospheric and soil heating. Here, we compared the shortwave radiation budget of two common Arctic tundra vegetation types dominated by dwarf shrubs (Betula nana) and wet sedges (Eriophorum angustifolium) in North-East Siberia. We measured time series of the shortwave and longwave radiation budget above the canopy and transmitted radiation below the canopy. Additionally, we quantified soil temperature and heat flux as well as active layer thickness. The mean growing season albedo of dwarf shrubs was 0.15 +/- 0.01, for sedges it was higher (0.17 +/- 0.02). Dwarf shrub transmittance was 0.36 +/- 0.07 on average, and sedge transmittance was 0.28 +/- 0.08. The standing dead leaves contributed strongly to the soil shading of wet sedges. Despite a lower albedo and less soil shading, the soil below dwarf shrubs conducted less heat resulting in a 17cm shallower active layer as compared to sedges. This result was supported by additional, spatially distributed measurements of both vegetation types. Clouds were a major influencing factor for albedo and transmittance, particularly in sedge vegetation. Cloud cover reduced the albedo by 0.01 in dwarf shrubs and by 0.03 in sedges, while transmittance was increased by 0.08 and 0.10 in dwarf shrubs and sedges, respectively. Our results suggest that the observed deeper active layer below wet sedges is not primarily a result of the summer canopy radiation budget. Soil properties, such as soil albedo, moisture, and thermal conductivity, may be more influential, at least in our comparison between dwarf shrub vegetation on relatively dry patches and sedge vegetation with higher soil moisture.",,,,"Schaepman-Strub, Gabriela/D-8785-2011; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010","Schaepman-Strub, Gabriela/0000-0002-4069-1884; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741; Heijmans, Monique/0000-0002-6036-4039; Grunberg, Inge/0000-0002-5748-8102",,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2016,13,13,,,,,4049,4064,,10.5194/bg-13-4049-2016,,,,,,,WOS:000381099900014,,,,,09/09/2020,204,empirical,community radiation budget,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Our idealized method prescribes aerosol concentration, linearly increasing from 2020 to 2100, and thereafter remaining constant until 2200. In the aggressive scenario, the model projects a cooling trend toward 2100 despite warming that persists in the high latitudes. Following SAI termination in 2100, a rapid global warming of 0.35Kyr(-1) is simulated in the subsequent 10years, and the global mean temperature returns to levels close to the reference state, though roughly 0.5K cooler. In contrast to earlier findings, we show a weak response in the terrestrial carbon sink during SAI implementation in the 21st century, which we attribute to nitrogen limitation. The SAI increases the land carbon uptake in the temperate forest-, grassland-, and shrub-dominated regions. The resultant lower temperatures lead to a reduction in the heterotrophic respiration rate and increase soil carbon retention. Changes in precipitation patterns are key drivers for variability in vegetation carbon. Upon SAI termination, the level of vegetation carbon storage returns to the reference case, whereas the soil carbon remains high. The ocean absorbs nearly 10% more carbon in the geoengineered simulation than in the reference simulation, leading to a approximate to 15ppm lower atmospheric CO2 concentration in 2100. The largest enhancement in uptake occurs in the North Atlantic. In both hemispheres' polar regions, SAI delays the sea ice melting and, consequently, export production remains low. In the deep water of North Atlantic, SAI-induced circulation changes accelerate the ocean acidification rate and broaden the affected area.",,,,,"Tjiputra, Jerry/0000-0002-4600-2453; Lee, Hanna/0000-0002-2003-4377",,,,,,,,,,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,JAN,2016,121,1,,,,,2,27,,10.1002/2015JG003045,,,,,,,WOS:000370173100001,,,,,09/09/2020,205,modelling,global carbon cycle,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Gullying decreased soil moisture by 40% and thaw-front depth by 10 cm in the center of breached polygons within less than 5 years after the inception of ice wedge degradation, entailing a gradual yet marked vegetation shift from wet to mesic plant communities within 5 to 10 years. This transition was accompanied by a five times decrease in graminoid above-ground biomass. Soil moisture and thaw-front depth changed almost immediately following gullying initiation as they were of similar magnitude between older (> 5 years) and recently (< 5 years) disturbed polygons. In contrast, there was a lag-time in vegetation response to the altered physical environment with plant species richness and biomass differing between the two types of disturbed polygons. To date (10 years after disturbance), the stable state of the mesic environment cover has not been fully reached yet. Our results illustrate that wetlands are highly vulnerable to thermo-erosion processes, which drive landscape transformation on a relative short period of time for High Arctic perennial plant communities (5 to 10 years). Such succession towards mesic plant communities can have substantial consequences on the food availability for herbivores and carbon emissions of Arctic ecosystems.",,,,,"Fortier, Daniel/0000-0003-0908-6157",,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2016,13,4,,,,,1237,1253,,10.5194/bg-13-1237-2016,,,,,,,WOS:000372082200024,,,,,09/09/2020,206,empirical,species diversity,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

R.",,,Biomass burning fuel consumption dynamics in the tropics and subtropics assessed from satellite,BIOGEOSCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Landscape fires occur on a large scale in (sub)tropical savannas and grasslands, affecting ecosystem dynamics, regional air quality and concentrations of atmospheric trace gasses. Fuel consumption per unit of area burned is an important but poorly constrained parameter in fire emission modelling. We combined satellite-derived burned area with fire radiative power (FRP) data to derive fuel consumption estimates for land cover types with low tree cover in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia. We developed a new approach to estimate fuel consumption, based on FRP data from the polar-orbiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) in combination with MODIS burned-area estimates. The fuel consumption estimates based on the geostationary and polar-orbiting instruments showed good agreement in terms of spatial patterns. We used field measurements of fuel consumption to constrain our results, but the large variation in fuel consumption in both space and time complicated this comparison and absolute fuel consumption estimates remained more uncertain. Spatial patterns in fuel consumption could be partly explained by vegetation productivity and fire return periods. In South America, most fires occurred in savannas with relatively long fire return periods, resulting in comparatively high fuel consumption as opposed to the more frequently burning savannas in Sub-Saharan Africa. Strikingly, we found the infrequently burning interior of Australia to have higher fuel consumption than the more productive but frequently burning savannas in northern Australia. Vegetation type also played an important role in explaining the distribution of fuel consumption, by affecting both fuel build-up rates and fire return periods. Hummock grasslands, which were responsible for a large share of Australian biomass burning, showed larger fuel build-up rates than equally productive grasslands in Africa, although this effect might have been partially driven by the presence of grazers in Africa or differences in landscape management. Finally, land management in the form of deforestation and agriculture also considerably affected fuel consumption regionally. We conclude that combining FRP and burned-area estimates, calibrated against field measurements, is a promising approach in deriving quantitative estimates of fuel consumption. Satellite-derived fuel consumption estimates may both challenge our current understanding of spatiotemporal fuel consumption dynamics and serve as reference datasets to improve biogeochemical modelling approaches. Future field studies especially designed to validate satellite-based products, or airborne remote sensing, may further improve confidence in the absolute fuel consumption estimates which are quickly becoming the weakest link in fire emission estimates.",,,,"van der Werf, Guido/M-8260-2016","van der Werf, Guido/0000-0001-9042-8630; Andela, Niels/0000-0002-8241-6143; Lehmann, Caroline/0000-0002-6825-124X; Wooster, Martin/0000-0001-6375-7949",,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2016,13,12,,,,,3717,3734,,10.5194/bg-13-3717-2016,,,,,,,WOS:000379427700014,,,,,09/09/2020,207,empirical,fire dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

A key enzyme in the decomposition process is phenol oxidase which is influenced by litter quality and, hence, a decomposition bioindicator. Here we investigated dwarf shrub litter decomposition following experimental community exposure to enhanced UV-B over two decades in the Swedish sub-Arctic. We examined the hypothesis that foliar UV-B exposure would alter litter quality to elevate phenol oxidase activity. This was tested in the field by measuring phenol oxidase activity in freshly collected mixed-community litter from under our experimental vegetation. A laboratory mesocosm was next used in a decomposition assay to investigate individual species responses over eight weeks, with an emphasis on the quality of leachate outputs from decomposing litter (from Empetrum hermaphroditum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium uliginosum). In the assay bi-weekly collections of leachate were analysed for phenol oxidase activity, together with total phenolics and dissolved organic C (DOC). At the end of the assay litter mass loss and respired C were also determined. The initial assessment on field mixed-community litter found no enhanced UV-B treatment (henceforth: 'UV-B treatment') effect on phenol oxidase activity. However, in the controlled laboratory mesocosm assay, significant species-specific effects of the UV-B treatment were evident, with increased phenol oxidase activity in V. vitis-idaea leachate (P < 0.001) and a significant reduction (P = 0.05) in respired C. Leachate DOC release from the UV-B treatment was greater in both Vaccinium species and the effect on V. uliginosum was significant (P < 0.05). The UV-B treatment had no effect on the total phenolic concentration of litter or leachates for any species, but there were significant differences in leachate total phenolics, both over time and between species. Also the initial phenolic concentration in leachates from the decomposing litter of E. hermaphroditum was greater than both Vaccinum species. Results suggest a species specific role for UV-B in influencing enzyme function and decomposition, dependent on individual traits. This has implications for decomposition dynamics in this system and more widely. Our study highlights the value of using a laboratory assay to gain a mechanistic understanding the species level impacts of a global change factor (UV-B) on decomposition, which are otherwise obscured by community-level responses and difficult to determine under field conditions.

Facilitating effects of benefactor plants on plant species richness have been commonly tested in stressful habitats because competitive effects are assumed to predominate in more productive habitats. Here, we examine this assumption by testing whether benefactor plants can nonetheless be facilitating in competitive environments. 2. We provide a conceptual framework describing how a trait of benefactor plants, canopy height of shrubs, can have a portfolio of facilitative effects on species richness in more competitive environments, and we provide an empirical assessment of this portfolio effect in tundra plant communities. 3. Across tundra plant communities representing an extensive gradient in aboveground live biomass ranging from 11 to above 800 grams per m(2), we found that species richness exhibited a humped-back relationship. Increasing canopy height of shrubs to a maximum height of what defines the dwarf shrub tundra, that is 40 cm, consistently and significantly increased species richness along the entire biomass gradient tested. 4. The positive effect of shrub canopy height was not confounded with herbivore intensity, competitive interference or abiotic factors such as bedrock-weathered mineral availability, moisture availability or temperature. However, we cannot rule out that the general presence of large mammalian herbivory may have been central to the positive effect of shrub canopy height in reducing herbivore impacts on species richness. 5. In this study, conceptual and empirical evidence support that increasing canopy height of shrubs facilitates species richness regardless of relative abiotic stress levels within tundra ecosystems. We propose that positive interactions can play an important ecological role in systems where competitive effects are observed or assumed. For tundra plant communities where climate change is currently causing encroachment of shrub species, the effects of increasing canopy height may have unprecedented effects on plant species richness.",,,,"Brathen, Kari Anne/AAN-4666-2020; lortie, christopher j/F-6241-2014","lortie, christopher j/0000-0002-4291-7023; Brathen, Kari Anne/0000-0003-0942-1074",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,JAN,2016,30,1,,,,,60,69,,10.1111/1365-2435.12458,,,,,,,WOS:000367855900007,,,,,09/09/2020,209,conceptual / empirical,species diversity,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Roots account for > 50% of net primary production in many ecosystems and are widely accepted as playing a fundamental role in ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. Despite this, the timing and controls of root production and the relationships between root and leaf phenology are still poorly understood in many plant communities, making it challenging to elucidate broad scale patterns and to predict ecosystem responses to a changing climate. Here, we investigate and compare the extent of synchrony of community-level fine root and leaf production in 10 widespread sub-Arctic plant communities, including deciduous forest, evergreen shrub, deciduous shrub and sedge-dominated communities. 2. We show that across contrasting plant communities, timing of leaf production does not vary substantially, but there are considerable differences in timing of root production between woody plant- and sedge-dominated vegetation. In sedge communities, root production occurs early in the growing season, soon after the peak of leaf production, whereas in woody plant communities, leaf and root production are highly asynchronous, with the majority of root production occurring late in the growing season. 3. Seasonal dynamics of root growth were not consistently correlated with soil temperature, suggesting that differences in timing of production relate to inherent differences between plant functional types. This raises important questions as to the drivers of root production, the functional reasons underlying these contrasting plant strategies, as well as the consequences for microbial communities and nutrient cycling of such contrasting timing of carbon inputs to soil. 4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that major differences exist in the synchrony of temporal dynamics of leaf and root production between woody plant and sedge-dominated sub-Arctic vegetation. The substantially greater asynchrony in root and leaf production in woody plants compared with sedges suggests that vegetation change associated with climate warming will result in significant shifts in timing of carbon fluxes to soil, and highlights the need for separate leaf and root components in ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycle models.",,,,,"Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,JAN,2016,104,1,,,,,239,248,,10.1111/1365-2745.12506,,,,,,,WOS:000368298700023,,,,,09/09/2020,210,empirical,root phenology,root phenology,"Petsikko, FI; Abisko, SE",69.75,27.017,monitoring,temperature; vegetation type,biotic; abiotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

Pitfall trapping of invertebrates and the sampling of higher and lower plants and habitat factors from quadrats were used on three replicate transects across a till plain accurately dated by annually monitored glacier front variations combined with the mapping of annual moraine ridges. Unstable, saturated sediments deglacierized for <1 year are colonized first by very large numbers of Collembola and a small number of epigeal beetles and spiders. Improved drainage, loss of fine matrix by pervection and frost sorting lead to the development of an active stone pavement after 6-21 years, which is colonized by sparse herbaceous perennials, a slowly-developing cryptogamic crust dominated by mosses, and moderately abundant epigeal beetles, spiders and the glacier harvestman (Mitopus morio). Further soil development and stabilization of the stone pavement lead, via a transition phase (21-26 years), to a fast developing ecosystem (26-33 years) in which the cover of most of the plants and pitfall catches of invertebrate groups are increasing rapidly (including a resurgence in Collembola catches and the spread of Racomitrium moss, terrestrial lichens and shrubs). Spatial heterogeneity reflects gradual successional trajectories related to small variations in physical habitat conditions. The sequence of changes is summarized in a conceptual geo-ecological model in which abiotic and biotic processes combine to drive the pioneer stages of both invertebrate and plant succession with little evidence of highly integrated biotic communities.

Phenological activities are among the most sensitive plant responses to climate change and have important effects at all levels within the ecosystem. We tested the effects of two experimental treatments, extended growing season via snow removal and extended growing season combined with soil warming, on plant phenology in tussock tundra in Alaska from 1995 through 2003. We specifically monitored the responses of eight species, representing four growth forms: (i) graminoids (Carex bigellowii and Eriophorum vaginatum); (ii) evergreen shrubs (Ledum palustre, Cassiope tetragona, and Vaccinium vitis-idaea); (iii) deciduous shrubs (Betula nana and Salix pulchra); and (iv) forbs (Polygonum bistorta). Our study answered three questions: (i) Do experimental treatments affect the timing of leaf bud break, flowering, and leaf senescence? (ii) Are responses to treatments species-specific and growth form-specific? and (iii) Which environmental factors best predict timing of phenophases? Treatment significantly affected the timing of all three phenophases, although the two experimental treatments did not differ from each other. While phenological events began earlier in the experimental plots relative to the controls, duration of phenophases did not increase. The evergreen shrub, Cassiope tetragona, did not respond to either experimental treatment. While the other species did respond to experimental treatments, the total active period for these species did not increase relative to the control. Air temperature was consistently the best predictor of phenology. Our results imply that some evergreen shrubs (i.e., C.tetragona) will not capitalize on earlier favorable growing conditions, putting them at a competitive disadvantage relative to phenotypically plastic deciduous shrubs. Our findings also suggest that an early onset of the growing season as a result of decreased snow cover will not necessarily result in greater tundra productivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,DEC,2015,21,12,,,,,4520,4532,,10.1111/gcb.13040,,,,,,,WOS:000364777400020,26183112,,,,09/09/2020,212,empirical,phenology,phenology,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

However, responses to global change can be highly species-and context-dependent. We examined community-level and species-specific responses to a six-year factorial temperature and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) amendment experiment in two alpine plant communities in northern Sweden: a species-poor dwarf shrub heath, and a more species-rich meadow. We hypothesized that abundance responses to global change would be variable within commonly defined vascular plant functional groups (e.g., forbs, evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs) and that new species would appear in experimental plots over time due to the ameliorated growing conditions. We found that within most functional groups, species were highly individualistic with respect to the global change simulation, particularly within the forbs, whereas within the shrubs, responses were neutral to negative and widely variable in magnitude. In the heath community the response of the graminoid functional group was driven almost entirely by the grass Calamagrostis lapponica, which increased in abundance by an order of magnitude in the combined temperature and nutrient treatment. Furthermore, community context was important for species' responses to the simulations. Abundance of the pan-arctic species Carex bigelowii and Vaccinium vitis-idaea responded primarily to the temperature treatment in the meadow community whereas the nutrient treatment had stronger effects in the heath community. Over six growing seasons, more new species appeared in the experimental plots than in control plots in the meadow community, whereas in the heath community only one new species appeared. Our results from two closely situated but different plant communities show that functional groups do not predict individual species responses to simulated global change, and that these responses depend to a large extent on pre-existing physical conditions as well as biotic interactions such as competition and facilitation.

Fertilization increased ground-layer shoot mass, the cover of grasses, and tended to enhance total root length below-ground, while it reduced the cover of low statured deciduous dwarf-shrubs. The only statistically significant interaction between vegetation type and fertilization was for grass cover, which increased twofold in forest understory but sixfold in tundra following fertilization. The lack of interactions for other variables suggests that the ground layers in these contrasting vegetation types have similar responses to fertilization.

We conducted a quantitative synthesis of published and original data on foliar losses of 793 species of woody plants belonging to 128 families from ca. 500 localities world-wide, representing tropical, temperate and polar climate zones. The background foliar losses to insects varied among plant life forms, increasing from dwarf shrubs to large trees, and were higher in inherently fast-growing species than in slow-growing species. These patterns supported predictions of both the apparency and growth rate (resource availability) hypotheses for data combined across localities, but only outside the tropics. Foliar losses to insects slightly but significantly increased with specific leaf area (SLA) in all climate zones. No differences were noted in background herbivory between woody plant species with deciduous and evergreen foliage, with different shade tolerance and with different successional status.Synthesis.

Extreme climatic events and population cycles of herbivores occur simultaneously against a background of gradual climate warming trends and can redirect ecosystem change along routes that are difficult to predict. Here, we present the results from sub-Arctic heath vegetation and its belowground micro-arthropod community in response to the two main drivers of vegetation damage in this region: extreme winter warming events and subsequent outbreaks of the defoliating autumnal moth caterpillar (Epirrita autumnata). Evergreen dwarf shrub biomass decreased (30%) following extreme winter warming events and again by moth caterpillar grazing. Deciduous shrubs that were previously exposed to an extreme winter warming event were not affected by the moth caterpillar grazing, while those that were not exposed to warming events (control plots) showed reduced (23%) biomass from grazing. Cryptogam cover increased irrespective of grazing or winter warming events. Micro-arthropods declined (46%) following winter warming but did not respond to changes in plant community. Extreme winter warming and caterpillar grazing suppressed the CO2 fluxes of the ecosystem. Evergreen dwarf shrubs are disadvantaged in a future sub-Arctic with more stochastic climatic and biotic events. Given that summer warming may further benefit deciduous over evergreen shrubs, event and trend climate change may both act against evergreen shrubs and the ecosystem functions they provide. This is of particular concern given that Arctic heath vegetation is typically dominated by evergreen shrubs. Other components of the vegetation showed variable responses to abiotic and biotic events, and their interaction indicates that sub-Arctic vegetation response to multiple pressures is not easy to predict from single-factor responses.

To understand the patterns and drivers of this vegetational change and the associated late-Holocene environmental dynamics, we analyzed radiocarbon-dated sediments from Grizzly Lake for chironomids, diatoms, pollen, macrofossils, charcoal, element composition, particle size, and magnetic properties for the period 4100-1800 cal BP. Chironamid assemblages assemblages reveal two episodes of decreased July temperature, at ca. 3300-3150 (ca -1 degrees C) and 2900-2550 cal BP (ca -2 degrees C). These episodes coincided with climate change elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, atmospheric reorganization, and low solar activity. Diatom-inferred lake levels dropped by ca. 5 m at 3200 cal BP, suggesting dry conditions during the period 3200-1800 cal BP. P. glauca declined and P. mariana expanded at ca. 3200 cal BP; this vegetational change was linked to diatom-inferred low lake levels and thus decreased moisture availability. Forest cover declined at 3300-3100, 2800-2500 and 2300-2100 cal BP and soil erosion as inferred from increased values of Al, K, Si, Ti, and Ca intensified, when solar irradiance was low. Plant taxa adapted to disturbance and cold climate (e.g. Alnus viridis, shrub Betula, Epilobium) expanded during these periods of reduced forest cover. This open vegetation type was associated with high fire activity that peaked at 2800 cal BP, when climatic conditions were particularly cold and dry. Forest recovery lagged behind subsequent climate warming (<+3 degrees C) by ca. 75 -225 years. Our multiproxy data set suggests that P. glauca was dominant under warm-moist climatic conditions, whereas P. mariana prevailed under cold-dry and warm-dry conditions.

However, shrub-based dendrochronology has so far resulted in only a few long and climate-responsive ring-width chronologies at such stressful sites, particularly above the alpine tree line. A previous study on an alpine Rhododendron shrub species resulted in <80-year-long ring-width chronologies. Here, we collected Rhododendron agan-niphum var. schizopeplum stems from elevations between 4000 and 4500 m a.s.l. on the SE Tibetan Plateau and built six tree-ring width chronologies. One of them is 401 years long and well replicated from AD 1670 to 2011 (EPS>0.85), thus representing the longest shrub chronology available to date. A principal component analysis (PCA) converted the total variability of all six site chronologies into PCs. Then, the six site chronologies and the PC1, accounting for 65.9% of the total variance of the tree-ring width, were correlated with time series of monthly climate data. Based on this, the year-to-year variability of the ring-width indices was positively correlated with July temperature, which thus turned out to be the dominant factor controlling growth. Accordingly, such long shrub-ring chronologies may act as climatic and ecological proxies in treeless environments of the Tibetan Plateau.",,,,"Liang, Eryuan/A-1435-2010","Liang, Eryuan/0000-0002-8003-4264",,,,,,,,,,,,0300-9483,1502-3885,,,,OCT,2015,44,4,,,,,760,768,,10.1111/bor.12122,,,,,,,WOS:000362769600009,,,,,09/09/2020,218,empirical,shrub growth,growth,"Tibet, CN",30.25,95.583,dendrochronology,temperature,abiotic,Rhododendron agan-niphum,1,species,,WOS search

We conducted a quantitative research synthesis to test whether background losses of woody plant foliage to insects generally decrease from the equator to the poles, and whether geographical gradients in insect herbivory are stronger at higher latitudes than at lower latitudes. Location Global terrestrial ecosystems. Methods We used published and original data (3482 point estimates of the percentage of leaf area consumed by insects, collected from 941 species of woody plants in 836 localities world-wide) to analyse the geographical patterns in total losses of plant foliage and in losses to defoliating, leaf mining and leaf galling insects separately, and we searched for climatic factors that can explain the variation in the levels of background insect herbivory across the globe and within climate zones. Result On average, according to published data woody plants lose 7.55% of their leaf area to insects, but 4.73% according to our original data collected in a blinded way. These losses demonstrate a dome-shaped latitudinal pattern: they peak in temperate zones, slightly decrease towards the equator and strongly decrease towards the poles. This pattern is consistent between published and original data, indicating the robustness of the detected relationship between herbivory and latitude. The climatic factors explaining these latitudinal patterns in insect herbivory differ between climate zones. Main conclusions Our study provides solid support for the hypothesis of a decrease in background herbivory with latitude, but only outside the tropics. For the first time we demonstrate that the latitudinal gradient in insect herbivory across the globe is nonlinear, i.e. its slope differs between the climate zones. In temperate and polar zones, but not in the tropics, background herbivory correlates with mean air temperatures and is therefore likely to increase with climate warming.",,,,"Lanta, Vojtech/J-7032-2017; Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013; Zvereva, Elena L./M-8490-2016","Lanta, Vojtech/0000-0003-4484-3838; Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244; Zvereva, Elena L./0000-0003-2934-3421",,,,,,,,,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,OCT,2015,24,10,,,,,1126,1135,,10.1111/geb.12347,,,,,,,WOS:000362796200003,,,,,09/09/2020,219,meta-analysis,insect herbivory,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In 18 boreal forest sites, we added flowering Melilotus albus to some sites and left some sites as controls in 2 different years to test if the invasive plant influences the pollination and reproductive success of two co-flowering ericaceous species: Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Rhododendron groenlandicum. We found that M. albus increased the pollinator diversity and tended to increase visitation rates to the focal native plant species compared to control sites. Melilotus albus facilitated greater seed production per berry in V. vitis-idaea when we added 120 plants compared to when we added 40 plants or in control sites. In R. groenlandicum, increasing numbers of M. albus inflorescences lowered conspecific pollen loads and percentage of flowers pollinated; however, no differences in fruit set were detected. The number of M. albus inflorescences had greater importance in explaining R. groenlandicum pollination compared to other environmental variables such as weather and number of native flowers, and had greater importance in lower quality black spruce sites than in mixed deciduous and white spruce sites for explaining the percentage of V. vitis-idaea flowers pollinated.

Our goal was to determine the environments where tall shrubs thrive and use this information to predict the location of future shrub expansion. The study area covers over 80,000 km(2) and has mostly tundra vegetation. Large canopy volumes were uncommon, with volumes over 0.5 m(3)/m(2) present on just 8% of plots. Shrub canopy volumes were highest where mean July temperatures were above 10.5 degrees C and on weakly acid to neutral soils (pH of 6 to 7) with deep summer thaw (>80 cm) and good drainage. On many sites, flooding helped maintain favorable soil conditions for shrub growth. Canopy volumes were highest where the typical snow loss date was near 20 May; these represent sites that are neither strongly wind-scoured in the winter nor late to melt from deep snowdrifts. Individual species varied widely in the canopy volumes they attained and their response to the environmental factors. Betula sp. shrubs were the most common and quite tolerant of soil acidity, cold July temperatures, and shallow thaw depths, but they did not form high-volume canopies under these conditions. Alnus viridis formed the largest canopies and was tolerant of soil acidity down to about pH 5, but required more summer warmth (over 12 degrees C) than the other species. The Salix species varied widely from S. pulchra, tolerant of wet and moderately acid soils, to S. alaxensis, requiring well-drained soils with near neutral pH. Nearly half of the land area in ARCN has mean July temperatures of 10.5 to 12.5 degrees C, where 2 degrees C of warming would bring temperatures into the range needed for all of the potential tall shrub species to form large canopies. However, limitations in the other environmental factors would probably prevent the formation of large shrub canopies on at least half of the land area with newly favorable temperatures after 2 degrees C of warming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,SEP 17,2015,10,9,,,,,,,e0138387,10.1371/journal.pone.0138387,,,,,,,WOS:000361769400095,26379243,,,,09/09/2020,221,empirical,shrub canopy volume,canopy volume,"Northern Alaska, US",67,-158,monitoring,soil moisture; permafrost; soil pH; temperature; snowmelt timing,abiotic,Betula nana; Alnus viridis; Salix pulchra; Salix alaxensis,4,species,,WOS search

Deflation patches are identifiable as bare regions within a mosaic of shrub and graminoid tundra, and have the potential to alter regional carbon cycling and vegetation dynamics. Understanding the spatial distribution of deflation patches is an important first step in establishing the drivers, controls, and ecological impacts of wind erosion in the region. Using high-resolution WorldView-2 satellite imagery, we created a land cover classification and percentage vegetation cover map to investigate the regional distribution and variability of deflation patches. Across the study area, deflation patches account for 22 percent of the terrestrial land surface and occur in greater density closer to the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Farther away from the GrIS, local topography plays a larger role in determining the distribution of deflation patches, with wind erosion tending to occur on steep south-southeast-facing slopes. Parallels between the distribution of deflation patches and local wind patterns suggest that katabatic winds are an important driver behind deflation patch occurrence. Within deflation patches, graminoid cover increases with distance from the GrIS, due either to a lesser degree of erosion or to a longer recovery time. In the context of recent circumpolar shrub expansion, deflation might locally limit the dominance of shrubs by creating habitat more suitable for graminoids and is an important factor to consider when predicting vegetation changes in West Greenland. ?????,????????,??????,???????????????????????????????????????????????,??????????????????????????????,??????????????????????????????????????WorldView-2????,????????????????,??????????????????????,?????????????????,?????????(GrIS)????????????

La erosion eolica del suelo es la responsable de geoformas erosivas, o parches de deflacion, ubicuos en la region de Kangerlussuaq, en la Groenlandia occidental. Los parches de deflacion se identifican como terrenos desnudos que alternan dentro de un mosaico de matojos y tundra graminoide, y potencialmente pueden alterar el ciclo regional del carbono y la dinamica vegetacional. Llegar a hacer claridad sobre la distribucion espacial de estos parches es un importante primer paso para identificar los impulsores, controles e impactos ecologicos de la erosion del viento en la region. Con el uso de imagenes satelitales WorldView-2 de alta resolucion, creamos un mapa de la clasificacion de la cubierta de la tierra y del porcentaje de cobertura con vegetacion para investigar la distribucion regional y la variabilidad de los parches de deflacion. A traves del area de estudio, los parches de deflacion representan el 22 por ciento de la superficie del terreno emergido y ocurren con la densidad mas grande en las areas mas cercanas al Casquete Helado de Groenlandia (GrIS, acronimo en ingles). Mas lejos del GrIS, la topografia local juega un papel de mayor importancia para determinar la distribucion de los parches de deflacion, circunstancia en la que la erosion del viento tiende a ocurrir en las laderas empinadas que se enfrentan hacia el sur-sudeste. El paralelismo entre la distribucion de los parches de deflacion y los patrones locales del viento sugieren que los vientos katabaticos son un importante componente para explicar la ocurrencia de la deflacion en parches. Dentro de los parches de deflacion, la cobertura de graminoides se incrementa con la distancia al GrIS, lo cual puede deberse a un menor grado de erosion o a un periodo de recuperacion mas largo. En el contexto de una reciente expansion circumpolar de los matorrales, la deflacion podria limitar localmente el dominio del matorral creando un habitat mas apropiado para las graminoideas, y es un factor importante por considerar cuando se intente predecir cambios vegetacionales en Groenlandia occidental.",,,,,"Chipman, Jonathan/0000-0003-4629-5273; Heindel, Ruth/0000-0001-6292-2076",,,,,,,,,,,,0004-5608,1467-8306,,,,SEP 3,2015,105,5,,,,,875,890,,10.1080/00045608.2015.1059176,,,,,,,WOS:000361205000001,,,,,09/09/2020,222,empirical,sediment accumulation and distribution,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Here, we analyse circumpolar data from 37 Arctic and alpine sites in 9 countries, including 25 species, and similar to 42,000 annual growth records from 1,821 individuals. Our analyses demonstrate that the sensitivity of shrub growth to climate was: (1) heterogeneous, with European sites showing greater summer temperature sensitivity than North American sites, and (2) higher at sites with greater soil moisture and for taller shrubs (for example, alders and willows) growing at their northern or upper elevational range edges. Across latitude, climate sensitivity of growth was greatest at the boundary between the Low and High Arctic, where permafrost is thawing(4) and most of the global permafrost soil carbon pool is stored(9).

At background (non-outbreak) densities, they consume 5-15 % of woody plant foliage in forests across the planet. At the same time, almost nothing is known about the levels of insect herbivory in Arctic tundra. To test the hypothesis that the amount of plant biomass lost to insects in tundra is substantially less than in subarctic forests, in 2013, we explored foliar herbivory in woody plants at three sites in the Arctic tundra and four sites in the subarctic forests of European Russia. A vast majority of foliar damage was imposed by externally feeding defoliators. In forests, defoliators damaged three times more leaves and consumed eight times more leaf area than in the tundra. No miners were found in the tundra, and gallers affected five times less leaf area in the tundra compared with forests. An abrupt decrease in loss of woody plant foliage to insects between subarctic forests and tundra (from 4.34 to 0.56 %) supports the existence of a latitudinal gradient in herbivory in terrestrial ecosystems.

Here, we test the hypotheses of aeolian versus waterlain deposition of yedoma silt, elucidate the palaeoenvironmental conditions during deposition and develop a conceptual model of silt deposition to clarify understanding of yedoma formation in northern circumpolar regions during the Late Pleistocene. This is based on a field study in 2009 of the Russian stratotype of the 'Yedoma Suite', at Duvanny Yar, in the lower Kolyma River, northern Yakutia, supplemented by observations that we have collected there and at other sites in the Kolyma Lowland since the 1970s. We reconstruct a cold-climate loess region in northern Siberia that forms part of a vast Late Pleistocene permafrost zone extending from northwest Europe across northern Asia to northwest North America, and that was characterised by intense aeolian activity. Five litho-and cryostratigraphic units are identified in yedoma remnant 7E at Duvanny Yar, in ascending stratigraphic order: (1) massive silt, (2) peat, (3) stratified silt, (4) yedoma silt and (5) near-surface silt. The yedoma silt of unit 4 dominates the stratigraphy and is at least 34 m thick. It is characterised by horizontal to gently undulating subtle colour bands but typically lacks primary sedimentary stratification. Texturally, the yedoma silt has mean values of 65 +/- 7 per cent silt, 15 +/- 8 per cent sand and 21 +/- 4 per cent clay. Particle size distributions are bi- to polymodal, with a primary mode of about 41 mu m (coarse silt) and subsidiary modes are 0.3-0.7 mu m (very fine clay to fine clay), 3-5 mu m (coarse clay to very fine silt), 8-16 mu m (fine silt) and 150-350 mu m (fine sand to medium sand). Semidecomposed fine plant material is abundant and fine in-situ roots are pervasive. Syngenetic ice wedges, cryostructures and microcryostructures record syngenetic freezing of the silt. An age model for silt deposition is constructed from 47 pre-Holocene accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 ages, mostly from in-situ roots and from three optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of quartz sand grains. The C-14 ages indicate that silt deposition extends from 19 000 +/- 300 cal BP to 50 000 cal BP or beyond. The OSL ages range from 21.2 +/- 1.9 ka near the top of the yedoma to 48.6 +/- 2.9 ka near the bottom, broadly consistent with the C-14 age model. Most of the yedoma silt in unit 4 at Duvanny Yar constitutes cryopedolith (sediment that has experienced incipient pedogenesis along with syngenetic freezing). Mineralised and humified organic remains dispersed within cryopedolith indicate incipient soil formation, but distinct soil horizons are absent. Five buried palaeosols and palaeosol 'complexes' are identified within cryopedolith on the basis of sedimentary and geochemical properties. Magnetic susceptibility, organic content, elemental concentrations and ratios tend to deviate from average values of these parameters at five levels in unit 4. The cryopedolith-palaeosol sequence accreted incrementally upwards on a vegetated palaeo-land surface with a relief of at least several metres, preserving syngenetic ground ice in the aggrading permafrost. Pollen spectra dated to between about 17 000 and 25 000 C-14 BP characteristically have frequencies of 20-60 per cent tree/shrub pollen (mainly Betula and Pinus) and 20-60 per cent graminoids, predominantly Poaceae, plus forbs, whereas spectra dated to about 30 000-33 000 C-14 BP have lower values of woody taxa (about 10%) and are dominated by graminoids (mainly Poaceae), forbs (particularly Caryophyllaceae and Asteraceae) and Selaginella rupestris. The latter are more typical of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) samples reported elsewhere in Siberia, and the unusually high arboreal pollen values in the LGM yedoma at Duvanny Yar are attributed to long-distance transport of pollen. Three hypotheses concerning the processes and environmental conditions of yedoma silt deposition at Duvanny Yar are tested. The alluvial-lacustrine hypothesis and the polygenetic hypothesis are both discounted on sedimentary, palaeoenvironmental, geocryological and palaeoecological grounds. The loessal hypothesis provides the only reasonable explanation to account for the bulk of the unit 4 yedoma silt at this site. Supporting the loessal interpretation are sedimentological and geocryological similarities between the Duvanny Yar loess-palaeosol sequence and cold-climate loesses in central and northern Alaska, the Klondike (Yukon), western and central Siberia and northwest Europe. Differences between loess at Duvanny Yar and that in western and central Siberia and northwest Europe include the persistence of permafrost and the abundance of ground ice and fine in-situ roots within the yedoma. Modern analogues of cold-climate loess deposition are envisaged at a local scale in cold, humid climates where local entrainment and deposition of loess are generally restricted to large alluvial valleys containing rivers that are glacially sourced or drain areas containing Late Pleistocene glacial deposits, and thus glacially ground silt. The Duvanny Yar yedoma shares sedimentological and geocryological features with yedoma interpreted as ice-rich loess or reworked loess facies at Itkillik (northern Alaska) and in the central Yakutian lowland, and with yedoma in the Laptev Sea region and the New Siberian Archipelago. It is therefore suggested that many lowland yedoma sections across Beringia are primarily of aeolian origin (or consist of reworked aeolian sediments), although other depositional processes (e.g. alluvial and colluvial) may account for some yedoma sequences in river valleys and mountains. A conceptual model of yedoma silt deposition at Duvanny Yar as cold-climate loess in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 and MIS 2 envisages summer or autumn as the main season of loess deposition. In summer, the land surface was snow-free, unfrozen and relatively dry, making it vulnerable to deflation. Graminoids, forbs and biological soil crust communities trapped and stabilised windblown sediments. Loess accretion resulted from semicontinuous deposition of fine background particles and episodic, discrete dust storms that deposited coarse silt. Winter was characterised by deep thermal contraction cracking beneath thin and dusty snow covers, and snow and frozen ground restricted deflation and sediment trapping by dead grasses. Sources of loess at Duvanny Yar potentially include: (1) sediments and weathered bedrock on uplands to the east, south and southwest of the Kolyma Lowland; (2) alluvium deposited by rivers draining these uplands; and (3) sediments exposed in the Khallerchin tundra to the north and on the emergent continental shelf of the East Siberian Sea. Glacially sourced tributaries of the palaeo-Kolyma River contributed glacially ground silt into channel and/or floodplain deposits, and some of these were probably reworked by wind and deposited as loess in the Kolyma Lowland. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the sedimentary sequence at Duvanny Yar is traced from MIS 6 to the late Holocene. It includes thermokarst activity associated with alas lake development in the Kazantsevo interglacial (MIS 5e), loess accumulation, pedogenesis and syngenetic permafrost development, possibly commencing in the Zyryan glacial (70 000-55 000 cal BP) and extending through the Karginsky interstadial (55 000-25 000 cal BP) and Sartan glacial (25 000-15 000 cal BP), cessation of yedoma silt deposition during the Lateglacial, renewed thermokarst activity in the early Holocene, and permafrost aggradation in the mid to late Holocene. Beringian coastlands from northeast Yakutia through the north Alaskan Coastal Plain to the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands (Canada) were characterised by extensive aeolian activity (deflation, loess, sand dunes, sand sheets, sand wedges) during MIS 2. Siberian and Canadian high-pressure cells coupled with a strengthened Aleutian low-pressure cell would have created enhanced pressure gradient-driven winds sufficient to entrain sediment on a regional scale. Summer winds are thought to have deflated sediment exposed on the East Siberian Sea shelf and deposited silt as a distal aeolian facies to the south. Additionally, stronger localised winds created by local downslope gravity flows (katabatic winds) may have entrained sediment. Local katabatic winds in summer may have transported silt generally northwards towards the Kolyma Lowland, particularly during times of extended upland glaciation in the North Anyuy Range to the east during the Zyryan (MIS 4) period, whereas winter winds carried limited amounts of silt generally southwards as a result of pressure gradient forces. The Duvanny Yar yedoma is part of a subcontinental-scale region of Late Pleistocene cold-climate loess. One end member, exemplified by the yedoma at Duvanny Yar, was loess rich in syngenetic ground ice (Beringian yedoma). The other, exemplified by loess in northwest Europe, was ice-poor and subject to complete permafrost degradation at the end of the last ice age. These end members reflect a distinction between enduring cold continuous permafrost conditions leading to stacked ice-rich transition zones and large syngenetic ice wedges in much of Beringia versus conditions oscillating between cold permafrost, warm permafrost and seasonal frost, leading to repeated permafrost thaw and small ice-wedge pseudomorphs in northwest Europe.

Here, we present a more than 100years long Betulanana ring-width chronology from Disko Island in western Greenland that demonstrates a highly significant and positive growth response to both summer and winter air temperatures during the past century. The importance of winter temperatures for Betulanana growth is especially pronounced during the periods from 1910-1930 to 1990-2011 that were dominated by significant winter warming. To explain the strong winter importance on growth, we assessed the importance of different environmental factors using site-specific measurements from 1991 to 2011 of soil temperatures, sea ice coverage, precipitation and snow depths. The results show a strong positive growth response to the amount of thawing and growing degree-days as well as to winter and spring soil temperatures. In addition to these direct effects, a strong negative growth response to sea ice extent was identified, indicating a possible link between local sea ice conditions, local climate variations and Betula nana growth rates. Data also reveal a clear shift within the last 20years from a period with thick snow depths (1991-1996) and a positive effect on Betulanana radial growth, to a period (1997-2011) with generally very shallow snow depths and no significant growth response towards snow. During this period, winter and spring soil temperatures have increased significantly suggesting that the most recent increase in Betulanana radial growth is primarily triggered by warmer winter and spring air temperatures causing earlier snowmelt that allows the soils to drain and warm quicker. The presented results may help to explain the recently observed greening of the Arctic' which may further accelerate in future years due to both direct and indirect effects of winter warming.",,,,"Rachlewicz, Grzegorz/AAJ-1907-2020; Elberling, Bo/M-4000-2014; Buchwal, Agata/F-5516-2013; Hansen, Birger/E-5192-2015","Rachlewicz, Grzegorz/0000-0003-1826-2079; Elberling, Bo/0000-0002-6023-885X; Buchwal, Agata/0000-0001-6879-6656; Hansen, Birger/0000-0002-5440-6925; Hollesen, Jorgen/0000-0001-8775-2026",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JUN,2015,21,6,,,,,2410,2423,,10.1111/gcb.12913,,,,,,,WOS:000353977500026,25788025,,,,09/09/2020,227,empirical,shrub growth,growth,"Disko Island, GL",69.25,-53.517,dendrochronology,soil temperature; sea ice coverage; precipitation; snow depth,abiotic,Betula nana,1,species,,WOS search

This is especially necessary when findings from a site are applied to a much broader geographic area. Here, we document vegetation change at Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska, occurring naturally and due to experimental warming over nearly two decades. An examination of plant cover, canopy height, and community indices showed more significant differences between years than due to experimental warming. However, changes with warming were more consistent than changes between years and were cumulative in many cases. Most cases of directional change observed in the control plots over time corresponded with a directional change in response to experimental warming. These included increases in canopy height and decreases in lichen cover. Experimental warming resulted in additional increases in evergreen shrub cover and decreases in diversity and bryophyte cover. This study suggests that the directional changes occurring at the sites are primarily due to warming and indicates that further changes are likely in the next two decades if the regional warming trend continues.

To assess potential effects of warming on diverse local-scale ecosystems (ecotypes) across northwest Alaska, we compiled data on historical areal changes over the last 25-50 years. Based on historical rates of change relative to time and temperature, we developed three state-transition models to project future changes in area for 60 ecotypes involving 243 potential transitions during three 30-year periods (ending 2040, 2070, 2100). The time model, assuming changes over the past 30 years continue at the same rate, projected a net change, or directional shift, of 6 % by 2100. The temperature model, using past rates of change relative to the past increase in regional mean annual air temperatures (1 A degrees C/30 year), projected a net change of 17 % in response to expected warming of 2, 4, and 6 A degrees C at the end of the three periods. A rate-adjusted temperature model, which adjusted transition rates (+/- 50 %) based on assigned feedbacks associated with 23 biophysical drivers, estimated a net change of 13 %, with 33 ecotypes gaining and 23 ecotypes losing area. Major drivers included shrub and tree expansion, fire, succession, and thermokarst. Overall, projected changes will be modest over the next century even though climate warming increased transition rates up to 9 fold. The strength of this state-transition modeling is that it used a large dataset of past changes to provide a comprehensive assessment of likely future changes associated with numerous drivers affecting the full diversity of ecosystems across a broad region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0165-0009,1573-1480,,,,MAY,2015,130,2,,,,,131,144,,10.1007/s10584-014-1302-1,,,,,,,WOS:000353465100006,,,,,09/09/2020,230,modelling,vegetation change,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

A dendrochronological analysis of Betula glandulosa,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"NDVI analysis and repeated aerial photographs have revealed significant shrub expansion in many subarctic regions. While the recent increase in temperature is usually considered to be the main driver of this phenomenon at regional scales, very little is known about the local heterogeneity of shrub responses across the landscape. In this study, we aim to identify the climatic factors controlling the growth of the largely distributed shrub species Betula glandulosa in three types of environments (terrace, hilltop and snowbed). We also aim to evaluate the relationship between B.glandulosa growth and the NDVI data for the Boniface River region, in north-western Quebec, where the study took place. In the field, we harvested 180 B.glandulosa individuals (20 per site, 3 sites per type of environment). We constructed specific growth-ring width chronologies and mean axial growth rate chronologies for each site and used them for dendroclimatic analysis (response functions). We also used linear regressions to evaluate the relative influence of dwarf birch growth on the NDVI trend. We found a sharp increase in B.glandulosa radial growth in the 1990s followed by a sharp decreasing trend from 2002 on terraces and hilltops, while growth remained high in snowbeds. Betula glandulosa growth was positively correlated with summer temperatures on terraces and hilltops, whereas winter precipitation promoted growth on snowbeds. The NDVI trend was largely correlated to B.glandulosa growth on terraces and hilltops for the period between 1986 and 2002 (71-80% explained variance).Synthesis. Our results suggest that topography plays a major role in B.glandulosa growth and therefore in shrub community dynamics. Because terraces and hilltops represent 70% of the land surface, the sharp B.glandulosa growth increase at these sites promoted an important overall expansion of the shrub community in the region. However, the decline in B.glandulosa growth observed after 2002 suggests that the expansion could be slowed down in the near future, therefore limiting shrub growth contribution to the regional NDVI signal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,MAY,2015,103,3,,,,,679,690,,10.1111/1365-2745.12394,,,,,,,WOS:000353640500015,,,,,09/09/2020,231,empirical,shrub growth,growth,"Northern Quebec, CA",57.75,-76.333,dendrochronology; remote sensing,temperature; precipitation,abiotic,Betula glandulosa,1,species,,WOS search

We further consider how foliar damage via insect herbivory (and outbreak) affects the soil community and decomposition. During the peak growing season (July 2011), we assessed how shrub community composition (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Vaccinium myrtillus, V. uliginosum and V. vitis-idaea) determined litter and soil phenol oxidase activity.

Nutrient addition decreased species richness and diversity and shifted the plant community toward dominance by dwarf birch, Betula nana, and a forb, Rubus chamaemorus. Generally, the composition of the seed rain resembled the adjacent plant community for deciduous shrubs, but not for other growth forms. Total seed abundance and proportion and total abundance of deciduous shrub seeds were greater adjacent to plots fertilized for 22 years. The deciduous shrub seed response was driven by a dramatic increase in seeds dispersed by Betula, resulting in lower taxa diversity, but not richness, of seed rain.

V.",,,Early-Holocene warming in Beringia and its mediation by sea-level and vegetation changes,CLIMATE OF THE PAST,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arctic land-cover changes induced by recent global climate change (e.g., expansion of woody vegetation into tundra and effects of permafrost degradation) are expected to generate further feedbacks to the climate system. Past changes can be used to assess our understanding of feedback mechanisms through a combination of process modeling and paleo-observations. The subcontinental region of Beringia (northeastern Siberia, Alaska, and northwestern Canada) was largely ice-free at the peak of deglacial warming and experienced both major vegetation change and loss of permafrost when many arctic regions were still ice covered. The evolution of Beringian climate at this time was largely driven by global features, such as the amplified seasonal cycle of Northern Hemisphere insolation and changes in global ice volume and atmospheric composition, but changes in regional land-surface controls, such as the widespread development of thaw lakes, the replacement of tundra by deciduous forest or woodland, and the flooding of the Bering-Chukchi land bridge, were probably also important. We examined the sensitivity of Beringia's early Holocene climate to these regional-scale controls using a regional climate model (RegCM). Lateral and oceanic boundary conditions were provided by global climate simulations conducted using the GENESIS V2.01 atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) with a mixed-layer ocean. We carried out two present-day simulations of regional climate - one with modern and one with 11 ka geography - plus another simulation for 6 ka. In addition, we performed five similar to 11 ka climate simulations, each driven by the same global AGCM boundary conditions: (i) 11 ka Control, which represents conditions just prior to the major transitions (exposed land bridge, no thaw lakes or wetlands, widespread tundra vegetation), (ii) sea-level rise, which employed present-day continental outlines, (iii) vegetation change, with deciduous needleleaf and deciduous broadleaf boreal vegetation types distributed as suggested by the paleoecological record, (iv) thaw lakes, which used the present-day distribution of lakes and wetlands, and (v) post-11 ka All, incorporating all boundary conditions changed in experiments (ii)-(iv). We find that regional-scale controls strongly mediate the climate responses to changes in the large-scale controls, amplifying them in some cases, damping them in others, and, overall, generating considerable spatial heterogeneity in the simulated climate changes. The change from tundra to deciduous woodland produces additional widespread warming in spring and early summer over that induced by the 11 ka insolation regime alone, and lakes and wetlands produce modest and localized cooling in summer and warming in winter. The greatest effect is the flooding of the land bridge and shelves, which produces generally cooler conditions in summer but warmer conditions in winter and is most clearly manifest on the flooded shelves and in eastern Beringia. By 6 ka continued amplification of the seasonal cycle of insolation and loss of the Laurentide ice sheet produce temperatures similar to or higher than those at 11 ka, plus a longer growing season.",,,,"Bartlein, Patrick J./E-4643-2011","Bartlein, Patrick J./0000-0001-7657-5685",,,,,,,,,,,,1814-9324,1814-9332,,,,,2015,11,9,,,,,1197,1222,,10.5194/cp-11-1197-2015,,,,,,,WOS:000362459100006,,,,,09/09/2020,236,empirical,historical vegetation changes,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Samples of living shrub, Salix glauca (greyleaf willow) were collected in 2012 from tsunami-flooded and non-flooded sites. The tree-ring analyses reveal unambiguously that the tsunami-impacted area was immediately colonized during the following summer by rapidly growing shrubs, whilst one of our control site specimens records evidence for damage that dates to the time of the tsunami. This demonstrates the potential for dendrochronological methods to act as a precise tool for the dating of Arctic paleotsunamis, as well as rapid post-tsunami ecosystem recovery.

Predicting the cumulative impact of these stressors requires an improved understanding of the factors affecting ecological resilience. In September of 1999, a severe storm surge in the Mackenzie Delta flooded alluvial surfaces up to 30 km inland from the coast with saline waters, driving environmental impacts unprecedented in the last millennium. In this study we combined field monitoring of permanent sampling plots with an analysis of the Landsat archive (1986-2011) to explore the factors affecting the recovery of ecosystems to this disturbance. Soil salinization following the 1999 storm caused the abrupt dieback of more than 30 000 ha of tundra vegetation. Vegetation cover and soil chemistry show that recovery is occurring, but the rate and spatial extent are strongly dependent on vegetation type, with graminoid- and upright shrub-dominated areas showing recovery after a decade, but dwarf shrub tundra exhibiting little to no recovery over this period. Our analyses suggest that recovery from salinization has been strongly influenced by vegetation type and the frequency of freshwater flooding following the storm. With increased ocean storm activity, rising sea levels, and reduced sea ice cover, Arctic coastal ecosystems will be more likely to experience similar disturbances in the future, highlighting the importance of combining field sampling with regional-scale remote sensing in efforts to detect, understand, and anticipate environmental change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,JAN,2015,25,1,,,,,172,185,,10.1890/14-0239.1,,,,,,,WOS:000348667900015,26255366,,,,09/09/2020,238,empirical,succession dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Our methods are based on grain size distribution, mineralogical composition, TOC/N ratio, stable carbon isotopes and the analysis of plant macrofossils from a 3.5-m sediment profile at the modern eastern lake shore. Our results show two main sources for sediments in the lake basin: terrigenous diamicton supplied from thermokarst slopes and the lake shore, and lacustrine detritus that has mainly settled in the deep lake basin. The lake and its adjacent thermokarst basin rapidly expanded during the early Holocene. This climatically warmer than today period was characterized by forest or forest tundra vegetation composed of larches, birch trees and shrubs. Woodlands of both the HTM and the Late Pleistocene were affected by fire, which potentially triggered the initiation of thermokarst processes resulting later in lake formation and expansion. The maximum lake depth at the study site and the lowest limnic bioproductivity occurred during the longest time interval of approximate to 7ka starting in the Holocene Thermal Maximum and lasting throughout the progressively cooler Neoglacial, whereas partial drainage and an extensive shift of the lake shoreline occurred approximate to 0.9cal. ka BP.

Detailed mapping of snow cover is very important for tundra areas under continuous permafrost conditions, because the snow cover affects the active layer thickness (ALT) and the ground temperature, acting as a heat- insulating agent. The information concerning snow cover with specific regime of accumulation can support studies of ground temperature distribution and other permafrost related aspects. Special attention has been given to the presence of shrubs and microtopography, specifically ravines in a modelling approach. The methodology is based on statistical analysis of snow survey data and on GIS (Geographical Information System) analysis of a range of parameters: topography, wind, and shrub vegetation. The topography significantly controls snow cover redistribution. This influence can be expressed as increase of snow depth on concave and decrease on convex surfaces. Specifically, snow depth was related to curvature in the study area with a correlation of R=0.83. An index is used to distinguish windward and leeward slopes in order to explain wind redistribution of snow. It is calculated from aspect data retrieved from a digital elevation model (obtained by field survey).

Yet, summer weather conditions, which differ greatly among years, are believed to have little direct effect on arctic plant productivity. The dominant view is that between-year variation in aboveground plant biomass is small and poorly related to weather conditions in the same year in the Arctic. Here, we test this view based on a 12-year investigation of peak plant biomass among habitats, plant functional types, and species in high-arctic Svalbard. Our study revealed twofold variation (range 23-46 g/m(2)) in plant biomass between years, this being strongly related to summer temperature (r = 0.92). Importantly, we found strong plant biomass-summer temperature relationships across habitats, plant functional types, and species, and little evidence for a lagged effect of previous year's biomass. Responses were of similar orders of magnitude, indicating that summer weather conditions were the key driver of plant productivity at all three levels of investigation. We propose three key factors behind such tight relationships between summer temperature and plant biomass in the same year. First, our methodological approach, a combination of nondestructive shoot density estimates in small, permanent plots and destructive shoot mass estimates outside these plots, allowed us to overcome the otherwise overwhelming small-scale spatial heterogeneity in aboveground plant biomass typical for high-arctic tundra vegetation. Second, the high-latitude location (78 degrees N) makes the vegetation most susceptible to temperature differences due to their influence on process rates. Third, Svalbard's oceanic nature dictates prevalent cloud cover, making summer temperature a good proxy for light availability and thus an index of photosynthetic activity required for plants to produce biomass. The present study challenges the prevailing notion that relationships between summer weather and vascular plant performance in the Arctic are weak and highly variable among plant species. This has important implications for our understanding of how and at which temporal scales future climate change will shape arctic plant productivity and, in turn, the dynamics of other ecosystem components in the low-productivity, bottom-up regulated ecosystems of the High Arctic.",,,,,"Stien, Audun/0000-0001-8046-7337",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,DEC,2014,95,12,,,,,3414,3427,,10.1890/14-0533.1,,,,,,,WOS:000346851400018,,,,,09/09/2020,241,empirical,plant biomass,biomass,"Svalbard, NO",77,15.333,monitoring,summer temperature; cloudiness; precipitation,abiotic,Salix polaris; Dryas octopetala,2,species,,WOS search

In addition, we observed various environmental parameters, including topography and soil moisture at four sites in the Indigirka River Basin, near Chokurdakh, northeastern Siberia. Most living larch trees grow on mounds with relatively high elevations and dry soils, indicating intolerance of high soil moisture. We found that needle delta(13)c was positively correlated with needle N content and needle mass, and these parameters showed spatial patterns similar to that of tree size. These results indicate that trees with high needle N content achieved higher rates of photosynthesis, which resulted in larger amounts of C assimilation and larger C allocation to needles and led to larger tree size than trees with lower needle N content. A positive correlation was also found between needle N content and soil NK4+ pool. Thus, soil inorganic N pool may indicate N availability, which is reflected in the needle N content of the larch trees. Microtopography plays a principal role in N availability, through a change in soil moisture. Relatively dryer soil of mounds with higher elevation and larger extent causes higher rates of soil N production, leading to increased N availability for plants, in addition to larger rooting space for trees to uptake more N.

Arctic ecosystems hold large stocks of potentially labile soil C and are dominated by plants with high root: shoot ratios. However, simple models of Arctic tundra ER typically use only aboveground drivers, such as air temperature and leaf area index. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we partitioned ER into its component fluxes in moist acidic tussock tundra, which is among the most widespread of Arctic ecosystems. To partition ER, we combined tissue-scale measurements of leaf, wood, moss, lichen, and root respiration with seasonal biomass estimates. Simple respiration models were fit to the data for each tissue type. Our results suggest that belowground respiration is a large proportion of ER and that its contribution increases over the course of the growing season with soil thaw. We estimated that bulk soil heterotrophic respiration made up approximately 40 %, root respiration made up 35 %, mosses contributed 8.5 % and all vascular plant leaves combined made up a mere 13.5 % of ER during the 2012 growing season. Our ability to model aboveground tissue respiration exceeded our ability to model belowground respiration. We hypothesize that effects of the aboveground climate on rhizosphere respiration, mediated by the production and delivery of photosynthate, may be a critical determinant of ER, as this would reconcile our results with simple models of ER.",,,,,"Sullivan, Patrick/0000-0002-8015-3036",,,,,,,,,,,,0168-2563,1573-515X,,,,DEC,2014,121,3,,,,,489,503,,10.1007/s10533-014-0017-8,,,,,,,WOS:000345320700003,,,,,09/09/2020,243,empirical,ecosystem respiration,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We studied the effects of large wood and terrestrial invertebrate supply, two factors affected by forest harvesting, on the growth and diet of two size classes of brown trout (Salmotrutta) during a two-month (June-August) field enclosure experiment. Twelve 20-m-long enclosed stream reaches were used in a 2x2 factorial design, with large wood either absent or added to mimic pre-modern forestry conditions, and terrestrial invertebrate inputs either reduced or maintained at ambient levels. The addition of large wood had a positive effect on the growth of large trout but no effect on small trout, whereas terrestrial invertebrate input had no effect on the growth of either size class. Growth rates were highest in the treatment with ambient terrestrial invertebrate inputs and added wood, were lowest in the treatment with reduced terrestrial invertebrate inputs and no added wood and were intermediate in the other two treatments. Dietary analyses showed no difference in treatments with and without added wood, perhaps because instream wood influences growth by producing profitable stream positions for trout, rather than by acting as a source of prey. Terrestrial invertebrate inputs affected the diet, as trout in enclosures with reduced inputs had a lower proportion of terrestrial invertebrate biomass in the diet than trout in enclosures with ambient terrestrial inputs. Our results suggest that leaving woody debris in streams when harvesting forests may enhance trout growth and that this is probably due to the physical changes in depth and current velocity caused by the wood rather than to changes in dietary prey composition. <doi origin=wiley registered=yes>10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2427</doi",,,,"Bergman, Eva/R-8464-2016","Bergman, Eva/0000-0003-2220-1615",,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,DEC,2014,59,12,,,,,2488,2501,,10.1111/fwb.12448,,,,,,,WOS:000344778800005,,,,,09/09/2020,244,empirical,trout diet,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

To examine if the physical effects associated with the construction, maintenance, and use of gravel roads alter vegetation and permafrost conditions, we measured vegetation, soils, and near-surface ground temperatures at tall and dwarf shrub tundra sites adjacent to and distant from the Dempster Highway in the Northwest Territories of Canada. We found that alder growth and recruitment were significantly enhanced adjacent to the highway. Where alder shrubs had formed closed canopies, we observed dramatic alterations to plant community composition, soil properties, and ground temperatures. Tall shrub sites adjacent to the road exhibited less understory vegetation, greater litter and organic layer thickness, higher nutrient availability, and thicker snowpack than all other site types. Our results show that in shrub tundra ecosystems the conditions generated by the maintenance and use of a gravel road can drive ecological feedbacks that magnify changes to vegetation communities and soils. We found that where the road facilitated shrub dominance, feedbacks were initiated that enhanced snow accumulation and altered ground temperatures and soil chemistry. In turn, these changes likely promoted enhanced shrub recruitment and growth.

However, there are still uncertainties related to local-scale patterns of shrub growth, resulting interactions among vegetation functional groups, and the relative roles of disturbance and climate as drivers of observed change. Here, we present evidence that widespread and rapid shrub expansion and lichen declines over a 15,000 km 2 area of the western Canadian Arctic have been driven by regional increases in temperature. Using 30 m resolution Landsat satellite imagery and high resolution repeat color-infrared aerial photographs, we show that 85% of the land surface has a positive 1985-2011 trend (P < 0.05) in NDVI, making this one of the most intensely greening regions in the Arctic. Strong positive trends (>0.03 NDVI/decade) occurred consistently across all landscape positions and most vegetation types. Comparison of 208, 1: 2,000 scale vertical air photo pairs from 1980 and 2013 clearly shows that this greening was driven by increased canopy cover of erect dwarf and tall shrubs, with declines in terricolous lichen cover. Disturbances caused by wildfires, exploratory gas wells, and drained lakes all produced strong, yet localized increases in NDVI due to shrub growth. Our analysis also shows that a 4 degrees C winter temperature increase over the past 30 years, leading to warmer soils and enhanced nutrient mineralization provides the best explanation for observed vegetation change.

Climate-induced forest dieback can have consequences on ecosystem services, potentially mediated by changes in forest structure and understory community composition that emerge in response to tree death. Although many dieback events around the world have been documented in recent years, yellow-cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis) decline provides an opportunity to study vegetation changes occurring over the past century. Current research identifies climate-related reductions in snow cover as a key driver of this species dieback. To examine the process of forest development post-dieback, we conducted vegetation surveys at 50 plots along the outer coast of southeast Alaska across a chronosequence of mortality. Our main study objectives were to examine changes in seedling and sapling abundance, and community structure of conifer species in the overstory; effects of yellow-cedar mortality on plant diversity and community composition of functional groups in the understory; and volume of key forage species for Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) managed throughout the region. The probability of yellow-cedar sapling occurrence was reduced across the chronosequence. Yellow-cedar seedling and sapling abundance also decreased. We observed a turnover from yellow-cedar to western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) dominated forests. Functional plant diversity increased and the community composition of the understory changed across the chronosequence. Bryophytes became less abundant and grasses more abundant in the early stages of stand development, and shrubs increased in relative abundance in latter stages. Our results demonstrate that yellow-cedar is significantly less likely to regenerate in forests affected by widespread mortality, and a species dieback can dynamically rearrange the plant community over time. These findings emphasize the importance of considering long-term temporal dynamics when assessing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services, and adapting forest management to a changing climate.",,,,"O'Hara, Kevin/AAH-6002-2020","O'Hara, Kevin/0000-0002-3800-9188",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,OCT,2014,5,10,,,,,,,135,10.1890/ES14-00225.1,,,,,,,WOS:000345097200013,,,,,09/09/2020,247,empirical,temperate forest vegetation change,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We compare limnological and biotic responses to flooding and expansion of a thermokarst lake basin (late 1950s), increased shrub growth in the catchment of another lake (since the mid-1980s), and regional warming (since the late 1970s). Among these three environmental drivers, the largest biotic responses occurred because of flooding and expansion of the thermokarst lake. An increase in the nitrogen isotope composition and decline in organic carbon isotope composition in sediments are interpreted to reflect an elevated supply of dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen. This was associated with significant shifts in composition of chironomid and diatom assemblages. In contrast, increases in particulate organic carbon and nitrogen from enhanced shrub growth had less influence on the biota. Declines in cold-water biotic indicators typical of warming lakes in Arctic regions occurred several decades after catchment-induced changes to the nutrient supply in both systems.

In the High Arctic, analyses of satellite images suggest a recent increase in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and warming experiments have shown a positive correlation between temperature and shrub cover, but little is known about the responses of natural systems. In this context, we investigated populations of Arctic willow (Salix arctica Pall.) to assess the potential contribution of this structuring species to High Arctic shrubification. LocationSeven polar semidesert sites, including two glacier forelands, in High Arctic Canada and Greenland. MethodsWe evaluated the size distribution and establishment age of Arctic willow populations through field measurements and dendrochronological analysis. We also assessed the cover of Arctic willow at each site and compared current data with historical records. ResultsAge determination of over 200 large individuals established by seed suggests that colonization events were associated with the melting of permanent snow and glacial ice. Size distributions showed that recent recruitment was more frequent on glacier forelands, even though seedling establishment was common in other sites. Comparing our measurements with previous studies at the same sites revealed that significant increases in cover over the past few decades occurred only on glacier forelands. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that the population structure and dynamics of Arctic willow in the High Arctic are influenced by site-specific factors. Rapid glacier retreat is increasing the extent of the glacier forelands, which are currently experiencing relatively rapid plant colonization. Some sheltered sites with greater snow accumulation will probably experience increased shrub colonization under current and predicted climate change. It appears, however, that shrub recruitment and growth are still strongly limited by water availability, and the reduction in permanent snow cover may exacerbate this stress.",,,,"Schmidt, Niels Martin/G-3843-2011","Schmidt, Niels Martin/0000-0002-4166-6218; Boulanger-Lapointe, Noemie/0000-0002-0104-6065",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,OCT,2014,41,10,,,,,1967,1978,,10.1111/jbi.12350,,,,,,,WOS:000342207600013,,,,,09/09/2020,249,empirical,shrub population dynamics,growth; cover,"Nunavut, CA; Zackenberg, GL",79.133,-79.733,dendrochronology; vegetation surveys,successional time,abiotic,Salix arctica,1,species,,WOS search

Global change, such as climate warming and nitrogen deposition, has been predicted to induce non-reversible regime shifts in natural ecosystems. However, we lack knowledge of the potential for recovery from global change perturbations and factors influencing the recovery rate. 2. We examined the recovery of an alpine plant community from a combined warming and nutrient addition experiment, which initially caused profound changes in plant community composition and diversity. We also examined whether the recovery process was affected by herbivory, as the presence of herbivores has been shown to modify the response of plant communities to global change. 3. Many aspects of the alpine plant community had not recovered from experimental warming and nutrient addition 6 years after cessation of the treatments. A persistent shift in vascular plant species composition seemed to inhibit recovery and maintain a community dominated by highly competitive grasses at the expense of the previously dominating dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala, lichens and bryophytes. 4. The exclusion of herbivores decreased the community recovery rate by maintaining unfavourable conditions for lichens and bryophytes. 5. Synthesis.

In the Central Platte River Valley (CPRV) of Nebraska, we evaluated factors influencing staging chronology, food habits, fat storage, and habitat use of sandhill cranes. We compared our findings to results from the Platte River Ecology Study conducted during 1978-1980. We determined spring migration corridors used by the breeding affiliations (designated subpopulations for management purposes) by monitoring 169 cranes marked with platform transmitter terminals (PTTs). We also marked and monitored 456 cranes in the CPRV with very high frequency (VHF) transmitters to evaluate length and pattern of stay, habitat use, and movements. An estimated 42% and 58% of cranes staging in the CPRV were greater sandhill cranes (G. c. tabida) and lesser sandhill cranes (G. c. canadensis), and they stayed for an average of 20 and 25 days (2000-2007), respectively. Cranes from the WA-S, NC-N, WC-A, and EC-M affiliations spent an average of 72, 77, 52, and 53 days, respectively, in spring migration of which 28, 23, 24, and 18 days occurred in the CPRV. The majority of the WA-S subpopulation settled in the CPRV apparently because of inadequate habitat to support more birds upstream, although WA-S cranes accounted for >90% of birds staging in the North Platte River Valley. Crane staging duration in the CPRV was negatively correlated with arrival dates; 92% of cranes stayed >7 days. A program of annual mechanical removal of mature stands of woody growth and seedlings that began in the early 1980s primarily in the main channel of the Platte River has allowed distribution of crane roosts to remain relatively stable over the past 2 decades. Most cranes returned to nocturnal roost sites used in previous years. Corn residues dominated the diet of sandhill cranes in the CPRV, as in the 1970s, despite a marked decline in standing crop of corn residues. Only 14% (10 of 74) of PTT-marked migrant cranes stayed at stopovers for >= 5 days before arriving in the CPRV, which limited the contribution of sites south of the CPRV for fat accumulation needed for migration and reproduction. Body masses of cranes (after adjusting for body size [an index of fat]) at arrival in the CPRV varied widely among years (1998-2006), indicating the importance of maintaining productive habitats on the wintering grounds to condition cranes for migration and reproduction. Average rates of fat gain by adult females while in the CPRV remained similar from 1978-1979 to 1998-1999 but declined among males. Distances cranes flew to feeding grounds in the CPRV increased as the percentage of cropland planted to soybeans increased and as density of cranes on nocturnal roosts increased. These results suggest that as habitats of limited or no value to cranes increase on the landscape, more flight time and higher maintenance costs may reduce fat storage. An estimated 40% of diurnal use occurred north of Interstate 80 (I-80) where <= 5% of lands dedicated to crane conservation are located. Seventy-four and 40% of PTT-marked EC-M and WC-A cranes had spring migrations that included staging in eastern South Dakota for an average of 11 and 10 days, respectively. Cranes of the NC-N, WA-S, and WC-A subpopulations staged an average of 25, 17, and 12 days in central and western Saskatchewan/eastern Alberta. Females in these affiliations increased their fat reserves after leaving Nebraska by an estimated 450, 451, and 452 g, respectively, underscoring the key role of these staging areas in preparing the 3 subpopulations for reproduction. After departing Nebraska, MCP cranes roosted primarily in basin wetlands. Most of these wetlands are in private ownership and lack adequate protection, emphasizing the need for effective laws and policies to ensure their long-term protection. The continued success of the current management goal of maintaining the MCP at approximately its current size and providing diverse recreational opportunities over a wide area of midcontinent and western North America is predicated on the ability of MCP cranes to continue to store large fat reserves in the CPRV in advance of breeding. For the CPRV to remain a key fat storage site, active channel maintenance (e. g., clearing of woody vegetation) likely will need to continue, along with establishing minimum stream flows. These actions would help ensure nocturnal roosting habitat remains sufficiently dispersed to provide cranes with daily intake of high-energy food adequate for major fat storage and limit risk of high mortality from storms and disease.

Quantifying the encroachment rate, testing which factors contribute to encroachment, and determining how encroachment is taking place and in which community types encroachment is occurring are essential for predicting shifts in tundra vegetation and carbon (C) storage. We examined willow cover changes from 1946 to 2008 in 18 ha of alpine tundra in Colorado using aerial photographs. We linked this pattern of change with experimental assessment of the effects of increasing summer temperatures, winter precipitation, and nitrogen (N) deposition factors that this region has experienced over this period on willow growth and survival. Shrub cover expanded by 441% over 62 years and is increasing at an exponential rate, corresponding to increases in C storage of 137 kg ha(-1). Nitrogen and temperature facilitate willow growth and snow increases survival, although N and the combination of N plus snow decrease survival. We find clonal growth (78%) accounts for more expansion than seed dispersal (22%), and that shrubs have expanded into wet, moist, and dry meadow.

Expected northward expansion and encroachment on arctic tundra in response to climate warming may be counteracted by natural and anthropogenic processes such as defoliating insect outbreaks and grazing/browsing regimes. Such natural and anthropogenic changes in land cover can substantially affect FTE dynamics, alter ground albedo (index of the amount of solar energy reflected back into the atmosphere) and provide important feedbacks into the climate system. We took advantage of a naturally occurring contrast between reindeer grazing regimes in a border region between northern Finland and Norway which was recently defoliated by an outbreak of the geometrid moth. We examined ecosystem-wide contrasts between potentially year-round (but mainly summer) grazed (YRG) regions in Finland and mainly winter grazed (WG) regions in Norway. We also used a remotely sensed vegetation index and albedo to quantify effects on local energy balance and potential climate feedbacks. Although differences in soil characteristics and ground vegetation cover were small, we found dramatic differences in the tree layer component of the ecosystem. Regeneration of mountain birch stands appears to have been severely hampered in the YRG regime, by limiting regeneration from basal shoots and reestablishment of individual trees from saplings. This has led to a more open forest structure and a significant 5% increase in spring albedo in the summer grazed compared to the winter grazed regions. This supports recent suggestions that ecosystem processes in the Arctic can significantly influence the climate system, and that such processes must be taken into account when developing climate change scenarios and adaptation strategies.",,,,"Vindstad, Ole Petter laksforsmo/P-5821-2019; Tejesvi, Mysore/M-7928-2015; Wali, Piippa/H-8562-2017","Vindstad, Ole Petter laksforsmo/0000-0003-2483-2568; Tejesvi, Mysore/0000-0002-6176-0981; Wali, Piippa/0000-0002-2484-7455; Jepsen, Jane Uhd/0000-0003-1517-1569; Cohen, Juval/0000-0001-6396-1536; Ahonen, Saija/0000-0003-3313-784X",,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,AUG,2014,17,5,,,,,890,905,,10.1007/s10021-014-9767-3,,,,,,,WOS:000339418400011,,,,,09/09/2020,255,empirical,forest vegetation change,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Moose are large, browsing ruminants in the deer family, which subsist on fibrous, woody browse, and aquatic plants. Subspecies exist which are distinguished by differing body and antler size, and these are somewhat geographically isolated. Seventeen rumen samples were collected from moose in Vermont, Alaska, and Norway, and bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced using Roche 454 pyrosequencing with titanium chemistry. Overall, 109,643 sequences were generated from the 17 individual samples, revealing 33,622 unique sequences. Members of the phylum Bacteroidetes were dominant in samples from Alaska and Norway, but representatives of the phylum Firmicutes were dominant in samples from Vermont. Within the phylum Bacteroidetes, Prevotellaceae was the dominant family in all three sample locations, most of which belonged to the genus Prevotella. Within the phylum Firmicutes, the family Lachnospiraceae was the most prevalent in all three sample locations.

We investigated whether shrub-induced changes in microclimate have stronger effects on litter decomposition and nutrient release than changes in litter quality and quantity. In arctic tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska, USA, we incubated a common substrate in a snow-addition experiment to test whether snow accumulation around arctic deciduous shrubs altered the environment enough to increase litter decomposition rates. We compared the influence of litter quality on the rate of litter and N loss by decomposing litter from four different plant functional types in a common site. We used aboveground net primary production values and estimated decay constant (k) values from our decomposition experiments to calculate community-weighted mass loss for each site. Snow addition had no effect on decomposition of the common substrate, and the site with the highest abundance of shrubs had the lowest decomposition rates. Species varied in their decomposition rates, with species from the same functional type not always following similar patterns. Community-weighted mass loss was 1.5 times greater in the high shrub site, and only slightly decreased when adjusted for soil environment, suggesting that litter quality and quantity are the primary drivers of community decomposition. Our findings suggest that on a short time scale, the changes in soil environment associated with snow trapping by shrubs are unlikely to influence litter nutrient turnover enough to drive positive snow-shrub feedbacks. The mechanisms driving shrub expansion are more likely to do with shrub-litter feedbacks, where the higher growth rates and N uptake by shrubs allows them to produce more leaves, resulting in a larger litter N pool and faster internal cycling of nutrients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JUL,2014,95,7,,,,,1861,1875,,10.1890/13-2221.1,,,,,,,WOS:000339470500015,25163119,,,,09/09/2020,257,empirical,decomposition dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Ecological studies recognize the importance of these extremes as drivers of plant growth and mortality, as well as drivers of ecological and evolutionary processes. Here we review observational and experimental studies on ECEs on herbaceous plants and shrubs. Extreme events considered were heat waves, drought, advanced or delayed snowmelt, heavy rainfalls, frosts, pulsed watering and flooding. We analysed 39 studies dealing with direct response of plant to ECEs in different ecosystems, with a particular focus on cold ecosystems (alpine and arctic). Although the number of studies increases every year, the understanding of ecological consequences of ECEs is fragmentary. In general, ECEs affected negatively on physiological processes (efficiency of photosystem II, stomatal conductance and leaf water potential), productivity and reproduction, and had consequences on population demography and recruitment several years after ECE. Indeed, the plant responses to ECEs were species specific and depended on the plant life stage and the timing of ECE. In fact, the magnitude of the effect of ECEs decreased over the growing season.

It is driven by the vascular cambium, which produces inward secondary xylem and outward secondary phloem. In the herbaceous plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), secondary growth occurs in stems, in roots and in the hypocotyl. In the latter, radial growth is most prominent and not obscured by parallel ongoing elongation growth. Moreover, its progression is reminiscent of the secondary growth mode of tree trunks. Thus, the Arabidopsis hypocotyl is a very good model to study basic molecular mechanisms of secondary growth. Genetic approaches have succeeded in the identification of various factors, including peptides, receptors, transcription factors and hormones, which appear to participate in a complex network that controls radial growth. Many of these players are conserved between herbaceous and woody plants. In this review, we will focus on what is known about molecular mechanisms and regulators of vascular secondary growth in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl.",,,,,"Ragni, Laura/0000-0002-3651-8966; Hardtke, Christian/0000-0003-3203-1058",,,,,,,,,,,,0031-9317,1399-3054,,,,JUN,2014,151,2,,,SI,,164,171,,10.1111/ppl.12118,,,,,,,WOS:000335803200007,24128126,,,,09/09/2020,259,empirical,Arabidopsis secondary growth,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Evapotranspiration, particularly transpiration, may be changing in response to changes in permafrost conditions, vegetation, and climate. This study focuses on the effect of permafrost thaw on boreal plant transpiration over two summers with contrasting weather conditions. We quantified the response of stomatal conductance (gs), from which transpiration was calculated, of deciduous and evergreen plants to soil environmental factors that permafrost thaw affects: soil water content (S), depth of seasonal thaw (D), and soil temperature (T). We found that gs was least sensitive to T compared with S and D at both sites and across both years. At the thawing site, gs was more sensitive to S in a dry year (2009) and to D in a wet year (2010). In the wet year, S of similar to 50cm represented a threshold wherein the sensitivity of gs to T and D switched between positive (S<50cm) and negative (S>50cm). However, the sensitivities to T and D were negative when S was consistently less than 50cm in the dry year. This is one of the first studies to explore the effect of permafrost thaw on boreal plant gs and transpiration, and our model predicted higher transpiration rates from deciduous plants located on thawing permafrost.

The arctic biome is currently increasing in deciduous shrub cover and this increase is expected to continue with climate warming. However, little is known how current deciduous shrub communities will respond to future climate induced warming and nutrient increase. We examined the plant and ecosystem response to a long-term (18 years) nutrient addition and warming experiment in an Alaskan arctic tall deciduous shrub tundra ecosystem to understand controls over plant productivity and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in shrub tundra ecosystems. In addition, we used a meta-analysis approach to compare the treatment effect size for aboveground biomass among seven long-term studies conducted across multiple plant community types within the Arctic. We found that biomass, productivity, and aboveground N pools increased with nutrient additions and warming, while species diversity decreased. Both nutrient additions and warming caused the dominant functional group, deciduous shrubs, to increase biomass and proportional C and N allocation to aboveground stems but decreased allocation to belowground stems. For all response variables except soil C and N pools, effects of nutrients plus warming were largest. Soil C and N pools were highly variable and we could not detect any response to the treatments. The biomass response to warming and fertilization in tall deciduous shrub tundra was greater than moist acidic and moist non-acidic tundra and more similar to the biomass response of wet sedge tundra. Our data suggest that in a warmer and more nutrient-rich Arctic, tall deciduous shrub tundra will have greater total deciduous shrub biomass and a higher proportion of woody tissue that has a longer residence time, with a lower proportion of C and N allocated to belowground stems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,JUN,2014,5,6,,,,,,,72,10.1890/ES13-00281.1,,,,,,,WOS:000338925000006,,,,,09/09/2020,261,empirical / meta-analysis,tundra plant productivity and nutrient concentrations,biomass; productivity; nutrient concentrations,"North Alaska, US",68.633,-149.633,factorial experiment,temperature; fertilisation,abiotic,Betula nana; Potentilla fruticosa; Rubus chamaemorus; Salix glauca; Salix pulchra; Empetrum nigrum; Rhododendron tomentosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea,8,community,,WOS search

The resampling shows major changes in species richness and plant cover. In general, there was a net immigration of species and 13 new species were found. Five rare species with initial low cover were lost. In the dry and wet snowbeds, species richness and total plant cover increased, mostly because of invasion by shrubs, graminoids and herbs. A general trend was that species indicating high soil moisture were strongly reduced. In the wetland zones there were no significant floristic changes but hygrophilous species had decreased and were replaced by graminoids and shrub species with lower water requirements.

We address this challenge in the thermokarst landscape of Old Crow Flats (OCF) using a combination of remote sensing imagery and monitoring of stable isotope compositions of lake waters over three thaw seasons (2007-2009). Quantitative analysis confirmed that the hydrological behavior of lakes is strongly influenced by catchment vegetation and physiography. Catchments of snowmelt-dominated lakes, typically located in southern peripheral areas of OCF, encompass high proportions of woodland/forest and tall shrub vegetation (mean percent land cover = ca. 60%). These land cover types effectively capture snow and generate abundant snowmelt runoff that offsets lake water evaporation. Rainfall-dominated lakes that are not strongly influenced by evaporation are typically located in eastern and northern OCF where their catchments have higher proportions of dwarf shrub/herbaceous and sparse vegetation (ca. 45%), as well as surface water (ca. 20%). Evaporation-dominated lakes, are located in the OCF interior where their catchments are distinguished by substantially higher lake area to catchment area ratios (LA/CA = ca. 29%) compared to low evaporation-influenced rainfall-dominated (ca. 10%) and snowmelt-dominated (ca. 4%) lakes. Lakes whose catchments contain >75% combined dwarf shrub/herbaceous vegetation and surface water are most susceptible to evaporative lake-level drawdown, especially following periods of low precipitation. Findings indicate that multiple hydrological trajectories are probable in response to climate-driven changes in precipitation amount and seasonality, vegetation composition, and thermokarst processes. These will likely include a shift to greater snowmelt influence in catchments experiencing expansion of tall shrubs, greater influence from evaporation in catchments having higher proportions of surface water, and an increase in the rate of thermokarst lake expansion and probability of drainage.

We manipulated the amount of in-stream wood and the flux of terrestrial invertebrate subsidies to determine how these factors affected potential food resources for drift-feeding brown trout (Salmo trutta ) in a boreal Swedish forest stream. Specifically, we followed the effects on the abundance of aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate fauna from June to August 2007. The treatments were 1) addition of wood, unmanipulated terrestrial invertebrate inputs, 2) reduction of terrestrial invertebrate inputs (using canopy covers), no addition of wood, 3) unmanipulated ambient conditions, 4) simultaneous addition of wood and reduction of terrestrial invertebrate inputs. Added wood resulted in greater biomass of aquatic invertebrate biomass, and both input and drift of terrestrial invertebrates were reduced by canopy covers. In terms of total potential prey biomass, the addition of wood with ambient levels of terrestrial invertebrate inputs had the highest standing crop of benthic, wood-living and terrestrial invertebrates combined, whereas the treatment with reduced terrestrial input and no wood added had the lowest standing crop. Our study indicates that forest practices that both reduce the recruitment of wood and the input of terrestrial invertebrates to small streams have negative effects on prey availability for drift-feeding brown trout.

The relative cover of shrubs in cells who changed was not higher in 2010 (6.1 +/- A 0.2 %) than in 1972 (7.3 +/- A 0.4 %). More than 70 % of birch and willow had more than 50 % of their shoot browsed, suggesting that caribou may limit shrub expansion at this site.

The rate and magnitude of change in soil fertility may be critical to determining plant community responses, and so effects of slow increases in nutrient availability due to climate warming may differ substantially from those of chronic high-level fertilizer additions. We investigated above- and below-ground plant biomass responses to experimental summer warming and above-ground responses to nutrient additions (low-level N and factorial N and P) in a mesic birch hummock tundra community in the central Canadian Low Arctic after eight years of experimental treatment. Plant community biomass responses to experimental warming were fundamentally different from those of high-level N and/or P additions, mainly due to opposing effects on the evergreen shrubs. Evergreen shrub above-ground biomass increased 66% with greenhouse warming, but decreased on average 70% with high-level N and/or P additions, driven by the strong responses of Rhododendron subarcticum. Because of this evergreen response, greenhouse-warming increased total above-ground biomass by 32% and total below-ground biomass by 70%, but did not significantly change the total above-ground/below-ground biomass ratio. However, warming increased the shoot/root ratio of Betula glandulosa threefold. Increased soil fertility created interactions between N and P availability, whereby increased P availability led to a substantial increase in inorganic N availability. Meanwhile, the growth of several species that span a range of different functional groups was stimulated by the separate N and P additions. These factorial fertilization results highlight the importance of understanding climate warming impacts on availability of both of these nutrients in order to predict plant community responses. Synthesis. Our results strongly suggest that the trajectory of mesic tundra vegetation change with warming depends critically on the rate of increase in soil fertility. The relatively large greenhouse-induced biomass increase in evergreen compared to deciduous shrubs suggests that carbon balance and albedo feedbacks to warming will be restricted in mesic tundra ecosystems, at least in their early responses to climate change.",,,,,"Zamin, Tara/0000-0002-0991-6651",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,MAY,2014,102,3,,,,,749,766,,10.1111/1365-2745.12237,,,,,,,WOS:000334588300021,,,,,09/09/2020,266,empirical,vegetation change,cover change,"Northwest Territories, CA",64.867,-111.55,factorial experiment,temperature; fertilisation,abiotic,Betula glandulosa; Vaccinium uliginosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Rhododendron subarcticum,4,species,,WOS search

In a mountain birch woodland-mire ecotone, we investigated the role of LAI (and NDVI), environmental factors (microclimate, soil moisture), and microsite type across tundra shrub plots (wet hummocks, dry hummocks, dry hollows) and lichen hummocks, in controlling net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). During a growing season, we measured NEE fluxes continuously, with closed dynamic chambers, and performed multiple fits (one for each 3-day period) of a simple light and temperature response model to hourly NEE data. Tundra shrub plots were largely CO2 sinks, as opposed to lichen plots, although fluxes were highly variable within microsite type. For tundra shrub plots, microsite type did not influence photosynthetic parameters but it affected basal (that is, temperature-normalized) ecosystem respiration (R (0)). PAR-normalized photosynthesis (P (600)) increased with air temperature and declined with increasing vapor pressure deficit. R (0) declined with soil moisture and showed an apparent increase with temperature, which may underlie a tight link between GPP and R (eco). NDVI was a good proxy for LAI, maximum P (600) and maximum R (0) of shrub plots. Cumulative CO2 fluxes were strongly correlated with LAI (NDVI) but we observed a comparatively low GPP/LAI in dry hummocks.

Many factors may affect the extent of this increase, including browsing by mammals. We hypothesize that across the Arctic the effect of browsing will vary because of regional variation in antibrowsing chemical defense. Using birch (Betula) as a case study, we propose that browsing is unlikely to retard birch expansion in the region extending eastward from the Lena River in central Siberia across Beringia and the continental tundra of central and eastern Canada where the more effectively defended resin birches predominate. Browsing is more likely to retard birch expansion in tundra west of the Lena to Fennoscandia, Iceland, Greenland and South Baffin Island where the less effectively defended non-resin birches predominate. Evidence from the literature supports this hypothesis. We further suggest that the effect of warming on the supply of plant-available nitrogen will not significantly change either this pan-Arctic pattern of variation in antibrowsing defense or the resultant effect that browsing has on birch expansion in tundra. However, within central and east Beringia warming-caused increases in plant-available nitrogen combined with wildfire could initiate amplifying feedback loops that could accelerate shrubification of tundra by the more effectively defended resin birches. This accelerated shrubification of tundra by resin birch, if extensive, could reduce the food supply of caribou causing population declines.

Here, I describe balsam poplar plant communities on the Arctic Slope and interior Alaska and Yukon. I established 32 releves, used the Braun-Blanquet approach to classify balsam poplar communities, and applied nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to identify the ecological gradients underlying community differentiation. The ordination revealed a clear differentiation between arctic and boreal communities. Ecological gradients, reflected by ordination axes, correspond to a complex productivity gradient and a complex gradient in slope angle and aspect. A new order and alliance are described, Populetalia balsamiferae and Eurybio-Populion balsamiferae, respectively. Within the alliance, two new associations are described: (1) Salici alaxensis-Populetum balsamiferae (arctic communities) with three variants (typical variant in riparian areas, var. Androsace chamaejasme on south-facing slopes and var. Cystopteris montana associated with perennial springs), and (2) Rosoacicularis-Populetum balsamiferae (boreal communities). In all communities, species richness is driven by herbaceous and woody species, which make up 85 % of the total species. Species richness of lichens and mosses is low throughout the communities, most likely because of annual flooding in riparian sites and shading by the balsam poplar overstory. A comprehensive baseline map documenting the current distribution of extralimital stands of balsam poplar is presented that significantly expands upon our previous knowledge of this species' northern distribution. A strong link between summer warmth index (SWI), the sum of mean monthly temperatures > 0 degrees C, and the presence of balsam poplar is observed for the Arctic Slope (SWI > 25 for 80 % of the stands). The alteration of temperature regimes resulting from global climate change will likely lead to an increase in the abundance and distribution of balsam poplar in Arctic Alaska.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-269X,,,,,FEB,2014,44,1-2,,,,,1,17,,10.1127/0340-269X/2014/0044-0522,,,,,,,WOS:000334570000001,,,,,09/09/2020,271,empirical,tree population dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search
J,"Jean, M; Payette, S",,,,"Jean, Melanie; Payette, Serge",,,Dynamics of active layer in wooded palsas of northern Quebec,GEOMORPHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Palsas are organic or mineral soil mounds having a permafrost core. Palsas are widespread in the circumpolar discontinuous permafrost zone. The annual dynamics and evolution of the active layer, which is the uppermost layer over the permafrost table and subjected to the annual freeze thaw cycle, are influenced by organic layer thickness, snow depth, vegetation type, topography and exposure. This study examines the influence of vegetation types, with an emphasis on forest cover, on active layer dynamics of palsas in the Boniface River watershed (57 degrees 45' N, 76 degrees 00' W). In this area, palsas are often colonized by black spruce trees (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.). Thaw depth and active layer thickness were monitored on 11 wooded or non-wooded mineral and organic palsas in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Snow depth, organic layer thickness, and vegetation types were assessed. The mapping of a palsa covered by various vegetation types and a large range of organic layer thickness were used to identify the factors influencing the spatial patterns of thaw depth and active layer. The active layer was thinner and the thaw rate slower in wooded palsas, whereas it was the opposite in more exposed sites such as forest openings, shrubs and bare ground. Thicker organic layers were associated with thinner active layers and slower thaw rates. Snow depth was not an important factor influencing active layer dynamics. The topography of the mapped palsa was uneven, and the environmental factors such as organic layer, snow depth, and vegetation types were heterogeneously distributed. These factors explain a part of the spatial variation of the active layer. Over the 3-year long study, the area of one studied palsa decreased by 70%. In a context of widespread permafrost decay, increasing our understanding of factors that influence the dynamics of wooded and non-wooded palsas and understanding of the role of vegetation cover will help to define the response of discontinuous permafrost landforms to changing climatic conditions.

Shrub recruits outside established patches represent the forefront of area expansion, but their dynamics may be sensitive to the action of several herbivore species. The empirical evidence for how different-sized herbivores affect recruits of tall shrubs is lacking. Moreover, although management and natural population dynamics of herbivores happens at landscape and regional scales, field research on herbivore impacts on shrubs seldom covers these scales. Reindeer management and different rodent population dynamics result in regional variation in herbivore abundances in arctic Norway. We conducted an herbivore exclusion experiment, covering three low-arctic river catchments with contrasting herbivore abundances. We assessed the impacts of small rodents and reindeer on growth, and survival of willow Salix spp. recruits after 3years of herbivore exclusion. As expected, the Salix recruits increased in sizes and had lower mortality when released from herbivores. Both types of herbivores had strong impacts on size and survival of Salix recruits. Spatially contrasting results were consistent with regional differences in the abundance of reindeer and rodents; herbivore impacts on shrubs were found when at least one type of herbivore was abundant. However, the impact was not independent of herbivore species. While both browsing from reindeer and rodents pruned the recruits and prevented them from escaping the field layer, the rodents also inflicted substantial mortality and thus thinned the stand of recruits.Synthesis and applications. Sympatric populations of rodents and reindeer have strongly complementary impacts on shrub recruits and may limit the expansion potential of tall shrubs even in the most productive habitats of arctic tundra. The spatial correspondence between shrub recruits performance and herbivore abundances, found after a short time period, suggests that the extent of tall shrub expansion in tundra is contingent on current variation and future trends in herbivore populations. In areas where humans control large herbivore populations, management may opt to counteract climate-driven shrub expansion also in habitats that are most prone to such expansion.

Here, CO2 efflux measurements using a manual chamber system within a 40m x 40m (5m interval; 81 total points) plot were conducted within dominant tundra vegetation on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska, during the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012, for the assessment of driving parameters of CO2 efflux. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model - a function of soil temperature, soil moisture, vegetation type, and thaw depth - to quantify the effects of environmental factors on CO2 efflux and to estimate growing season CO2 emissions. Our results showed that average CO2 efflux in 2011 was 1.4 times higher than in 2012, resulting from the distinct difference in soil moisture between the 2 years. Tussock-dominated CO2 efflux is 1.4 to 2.3 times higher than those measured in lichen and moss communities, revealing tussock as a significant CO2 source in the Arctic, with a wide area distribution on the circumpolar scale. CO2 efflux followed soil temperature nearly exponentially from both the observed data and the posterior medians of the HB model. This reveals that soil temperature regulates the seasonal variation of CO2 efflux and that soil moisture contributes to the interannual variation of CO2 efflux for the two growing seasons in question. Obvious changes in soil moisture during the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012 resulted in an explicit difference between CO2 effluxes - 742 and 539 gCO(2) m(-2) period(-1) for 2011 and 2012, respectively, suggesting the 2012 CO2 emission rate was reduced to 27%(95% credible interval: 17-36%) of the 2011 emission, due to higher soil moisture from severe rain. The estimated growing season CO2 emission rate ranged from 0.86 Mg CO2 in 2012 to 1.20 Mg CO2 in 2011 within a 40m x 40m plot, corresponding to 86 and 80% of annual CO2 emission rates within the western Alaska tundra ecosystem, estimated from the temperature dependence of CO2 efflux. Therefore, this HB model can be readily applied to observed CO2 efflux, as it demands only four environmental factors and can also be effective for quantitatively assessing the driving parameters of CO2 efflux.",,,,"Kim, Yongwon/F-4683-2010; Park, Sang-Jong/B-7049-2011","Kim, Yongwon/0000-0002-6513-4777; Park, Sang-Jong/0000-0002-6944-6962; Nishina, Kazuya/0000-0002-8820-1282",,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2014,11,19,,,,,5567,5579,,10.5194/bg-11-5567-2014,,,,,,,WOS:000344153200019,,,,,09/09/2020,275,empirical / modelling,carbon fluxes,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Differences between plants representing regions were greater than between the samples within regions with regard to the four characters. The most visible division ran between the samples coming from the southern and the northern parts of the range, with the sample from the Western Scandinavia occupying the central position. Correlations between characters and climactic factors were shown, and the size of the leaf was associated mainly with the minimum temperatures of spring months, while the leaf shape with the rainfall during the summer months. Characters differentiating the regions and discriminating populations strongly were mostly dependent on the influence of the climate.

Here I report on a three-year experiment that manipulated air temperature using ITEX passive warming cones and N deposition in a mountain meadow ecosystems that were historically grazed or protected from grazing. The strongest and most consistent effect was due to the legacy of grazing, with previously grazed sites having lower primary production, lower soil respiration rates, lower soil moisture, and lower soil C and N stocks than historically ungrazed sites. Warming increased soil respiration, but the effect was transient, and decreased over the 3-year study. Nitrogen addition increased primary production in the second and third year of the experiment but had no significant effect on soil respiration. The effect of historical grazing on primary production was approximately double the effect of N addition. Temperature and N deposition rarely interacted except for increasing N availability during the warm, wet growing season of 2004.

However, there are discrepancies between the results of many previous modelling studies and the proxy data at high latitudes, with models struggling to simulate the shallow temperature gradients of this time period to the same extent as the proxies indicate. Vegetation-climate feedbacks play an important role in the present day, but are often neglected in these palaeoclimate modelling studies, and this may be a contributing factor to resolving the model-data discrepancy. Here we investigate these vegetation-climate feedbacks by carrying out simulations of the early Eocene climate at 2x and 4x pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 with fixed vegetation (homogeneous shrubs everywhere) and dynamic vegetation. The results show that the simulations with dynamic vegetation are warmer in the global annual mean than the simulations with fixed shrubs by 0.9 degrees C at 2x and 1.8 degrees C at 4x. Consequently, the warming when CO2 is doubled from 2x to 4x is 1 degrees C higher (in the global annual mean) with dynamic vegetation than with fixed shrubs. This corresponds to an increase in climate sensitivity of 26 %. This difference in warming is enhanced at high latitudes, with temperatures increasing by over 50% in some regions of Antarctica. In the Arctic, ice-albedo feedbacks are responsible for the majority of this warming. On a global scale, energy balance analysis shows that the enhanced warming with dynamic vegetation is mainly associated with an increase in atmospheric water vapour but changes in clouds also contribute to the temperature increase. It is likely that changes in surface albedo due to changes in vegetation cover resulted in an initial warming which triggered these water vapour feedbacks. In conclusion, dynamic vegetation goes some way to resolving the discrepancy, but our modelled temperatures cannot reach the same warmth as the data suggest in the Arctic. This suggests that there are additional mechanisms, not included in this modelling framework, behind the polar warmth or that the proxies have been misinterpreted.",,,,"Lunt, Daniel J/G-9451-2011","Lunt, Daniel J/0000-0003-3585-6928",,,,,,,,,,,,1814-9324,1814-9332,,,,,2014,10,2,,,,,419,436,,10.5194/cp-10-419-2014,,,,,,,WOS:000335374600001,,,,,09/09/2020,278,empirical,historical vegetation-climate feedbacks,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In this study we examine the impact of Pleistocene climatic changes on two closely related Xanthomendoza (Teloschistaceae, Ascomycota) species with distinct distribution patterns and reproductive strategies. We selected X. borealis, which occurs in polar regions of both hemispheres, and the corticolous X. montana, which is restricted to montane shrublands in western North America. We analyzed the complete nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) to confirm the monophyly and relative ages of X. borealis and X. montana. We estimated molecular diversity and population demographics statistics, mismatch distributions, and Bayesian skyline plots for both species. Our data indicate that X. montana experienced a Late Pleistocene population expansion. We suggest that major shifts in vegetation types as a result of Pleistocene climate change had a substantial impact on distribution patterns and the demographic history of X. montana. In contrast, results from this study indicate that the demographic history of X. borealis is consistent with long-term stability, although low genetic variability in the ITS marker for X. borealis limits overall confidence in this inference. We propose that X. borealis has been able to maintain a stable population size across climatic shifts, likely through effective dispersal to suitable habitats and suggests that climatic conditions during Pleistocene glacial cycles were not inherently unfavorable or restrictive for some high altitude/latitude lichen-forming fungal species. Investigating mating systems for these two Xanthomendoza species may provide important insights about the factors affecting population demographics and reproduction in lichen-forming fungi in general.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-2745,1938-4378,,,,WIN,2013,116,4,,,,,337,349,,10.1639/0007-2745-116.4.337,,,,,,,WOS:000329269500003,,,,,09/09/2020,279,empirical,fungal demography,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Since environmental perturbations commonly occur in concert, there is a need for experimental investigations in which single, combined and interactive effects of environmental factors are studied. We studied interactive effects of N-fertilization (40 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and disturbance, i.e. removing the vegetation and soil organic layers, in the forest-tundra ecotone in northern Finland during 2002-2005. Plant abundances were measured in a coniferous forest, mountain birch forest and tundra heath. Both N-fertilization and disturbance reinforced the proportion of deciduous (Vaccinium myrtillus) and the graminoids (i.e. Deschampsia flexuosa and Carex sp.) at the expense of evergreens in vegetation. N-fertilization also enhanced the post-disturbance recovery of graminoids. Vegetation recovery was slow in the tundra heath, where N-fertilization decreased the abundance of the evergreen Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum. Although the changes in vegetation due to the N-fertilization and disturbance could be detected, they did not change the initial dominance of plant functional types. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing N affects the rate rather than direction of recovery after disturbance. Moreover, plant communities differ in terms of their capabilities to respond to multiple perturbations which should be taken into account when evaluating future vegetation responses under changing environment in at high-latitude and high-altitude ecosystems.",,,,"Tolvanen, Anne/AAP-8246-2020; Tolvanen, Anne/I-5873-2015","Tolvanen, Anne/0000-0002-5304-7510; Tolvanen, Anne/0000-0002-5304-7510",,,,,,,,,,,,1385-0237,1573-5052,,,,DEC,2013,214,12,,,,,1505,1516,,10.1007/s11258-013-0271-1,,,,,,,WOS:000327093200010,,,,,09/09/2020,280,empirical,disturbance response,cover change,"Ounastunturi, FI",68.233,23.75,factorial experiment,fertilisation; disturbance,abiotic,Vaccinium myrtillus; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Empetrum nigrum,3,species,,WOS search

In the tundra, grazing by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) affects vegetation and soil nutrient availability, but almost nothing is known about the interactions between grazing and global climate change on plant phenolics. We performed a factorial warming and fertilization experiment in a tundra ecosystem under light grazing and heavy grazing and analyzed individual foliar phenolics and crowberry abundance. Crowberry was more abundant under light grazing than heavy grazing. Although phenolic concentrations did not differ between grazing intensities, responses of crowberry abundance and phenolic concentrations to warming varied significantly depending on grazing intensity. Under light grazing, warming increased crowberry abundance and the concentration of stilbenes, but decreased e.g., the concentrations of flavonols, condensed tannins, and batatasin-III, resulting in no change in total phenolics. Under heavy grazing, warming did not affect crowberry abundance, and induced a weak but consistent decrease among the different phenolic compound groups, resulting in a net decrease in total phenolics. Our results show that the different phenolic compound groups may show varying or even opposing responses to warming in the tundra at different levels of grazing intensity.

To better understand how warming impacts arctic decomposition, we characterized the effects of a twenty-two year long tundra greenhouse warming experiment on decomposer-produced extracellular enzymes, nutrients, and microbial biomass across a year. This experiment, which is the longest running tundra ecosystem warming study in existence, was previously shown to have altered the plant and soil communities. The greenhouse treatment has also changed the seasonal soil temperature regime by indirectly increasing winter soil temperature, an effect that was likely facilitated through an increase in snow-trapping shrub biomass. Irrespective of the warming treatment, we observed that peak nutrient pools, microbial biomass, and hydrolytic enzyme activities all occurred from the late winter through thaw. This pattern was decoupled from peak oxidative enzyme activities, which occurred during the summer. The greenhouse treatment amplified the natural seasonal cycle of extracellular enzyme activities, suggesting that tundra decomposer communities maintain a temporal niche space which is critical to understanding how arctic biogeochemical cycling will respond to warming. A spatial separation was also observed; extracellular enzyme activities in the deeper soil horizons were more sensitive to warming than at the surface. Direct greenhouse warming did not strongly stimulate decomposition: only oxidative enzyme activities in the surface horizon increased during the summer. Unexpectedly, the strongest treatment effect observed was a stimulation of hydrolytic enzyme activities at depth in the mineral horizon from the late winter through thaw (which also affected extracellular enzyme stoichiometry, increasing C:N and C:P acquisition activities), before the greenhouse treatment was directly active. This effect declined during senescence and was reversed in early winter, suggesting that negative biotic-abiotic feedbacks may curtail increased decomposer activity in warming arctic systems.

The snow-shrub hypothesis asserts that shrub canopies trap snow and insulate soils in winter, increasing the rates of nutrient cycling to create a positive feedback to shrub expansion. However, previous work has not been able to separate the abiotic from the biotic influences of shrub canopies. We conducted a 3-year factorial experiment to determine the influences of canopies on soil temperatures and nutrient cycling parameters by removing similar to 0.5m high willow (Salix spp.) and birch (Betula glandulosa) shrubs, creating artificial shrub canopies and comparing these manipulations to nearby open tundra and shrub patches. Soil temperatures were 4-5 degrees C warmer in January, and 2 degrees C cooler in July under shrub cover. Natural shrub plots had 14-33cm more snow in January than adjacent open tundra plots. Snow cover and soil temperatures were similar in the manipulated plots when compared with the respective unmanipulated treatments, indicating that shrub canopy cover was a dominant factor influencing the soil thermal regime. Conversely, we found no strong evidence of increased soil decomposition, CO2 fluxes, or nitrate or ammonia adsorbtion under artificial shrub canopy treatments when compared with unmanipulated open tundra.

However, empirical studies show that the magnitude and direction of plant responses are highly species- and site-specific, suggesting that several additional drivers interact with warmer climate. We experimentally tested the interactive effects of climate warming, mammalian herbivory and soil fertility on low elevation plants. Seedlings of three warm-adapted lowland forbs (Epilobium angustifolium, Silene dioica and Solidago virgaurea) were transplanted to an open tundra site with native mountain tundra vegetation, and the effects of full factorial combinations of herbivore exclosures, warming and fertilization on transplant survival, growth and flowering were studied for two growing seasons. We also investigated the response of native vegetation biomass to the same treatments and compared it with the responses of transplanted lowland forbs. Effects of both warming and fertilization on the transplanted lowland forbs strongly hinged on herbivore exclusion, resulting in 2-13-fold increase in biomass in warmed and fertilized plots without herbivores compared with warmed and fertilized plots with herbivores present, the magnitude depending on the species. While warm-adapted transplants benefited from warming, the native tundra plant community biomass did not respond to warming treatment. Our results show that grazing limits the growth of transplants under warmer and more productive conditions, indicating that the expansion of lowland plant species to higher altitudes with warming may be hampered by mammalian herbivory. Furthermore, our results also suggest that migration of warm-adapted species into lightly grazed high-altitude tundra ecosystems might transform these communities to be more responsive to warmer climate and nutrient loads. Studies that do not consider species' upward shifts from lower altitudes might thus have underestimated vegetation responses to global warming, as well as the potential of herbivory to influence these responses.",,,,"Olofsson, Johan/A-9362-2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,OCT,2013,27,5,,,,,1244,1253,,10.1111/1365-2435.12113,,,,,,,WOS:000325366500016,,,,,09/09/2020,285,empirical,lowland plant expansion,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Changes in species composition within the major plant communities have ranged between almost no changes to almost a 50 per cent increase in the number of species. Changes in plant species abundance also vary with particularly large increases in trees and shrubs (up to 600%). There has been an increase in abundance of aspen and large changes in other plant communities responding to wetland area increases resulting from permafrost thaw. Populations of herbivores have responded to varying management practices and climate regimes, particularly changing snow conditions.

By annually monitoring community composition in grazed control plots and herbivore-free exclosures at an Arctic location for 15 years, we detected multiple biotic interactions. Regular rodent cycles acted as pulses driving synchronous fluctuations in the biomass of field-layer vegetation; reindeer influenced the biomass of taller shrubs, and the abundance of plant pathogenic fungi increased when densities of their host plants increased in exclosures. Two outbreaks of geometrid moths occurred during the study period, with contrasting effects on the field layer: one in 2004 had marginal effects, while one in 2012 severely reduced biomass in the control plots and eliminated biomass that had accumulated over 15 years in the exclosures. The latter was followed by a dramatic decline of the dominant understory dwarf-shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum, driven by an interaction between moth herbivory on top buds and leaves, and increased disease severity of a pathogenic fungus. We show that the climate has important direct and indirect effects on all these biotic interactions. We conclude that long time series are essential to identify key biotic interactions in ecosystems, since their importance will be influenced by climatic conditions, and that manipulative treatments are needed in order to obtain the mechanistic understanding needed for robust predictions of future ecosystem changes and their feedback effects.",,,,"Olofsson, Johan/A-9362-2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8436,1471-2970,,,,AUG 19,2013,368,1624,,,,,,,20120486,10.1098/rstb.2012.0486,,,,,,,WOS:000321565600008,23836791,,,,09/09/2020,287,empirical,vegetation-herbivore interactions,abundance; biomass,"Abisko, SE",68.323,18.866,herbivore exclusion,herbivory; temperature; precipitation,biotic; abiotic,Betula nana; Empetrum nigrum; Vaccinium uliginosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea,4,species,,WOS search

We asked whether aspects of plant growth were related to the climatic conditions measured at a local weather station over two approximately decade-long study periods (1977-1988 and 2001-2010) on both snowbed and non-snowbed sites. Although the latter period had average summer temperatures that were about 2 A degrees C warmer than the first, both had the same average growing season length and average total monthly precipitation. Snow accumulation and other climatic events shortened the growing seasons for the plants in the first period, thus reducing vegetative growth. On the other hand, climatic events prolonging the growing seasons supported plant growth and flowering in the snowbed site. In the second, warmer period, growing season lengths were not related to plant performance but August temperatures had a positive effect on plant growth in both the snowbed and non-snowbed sites.

Organisms alter their gene expression and metabolism to increase the concentrations of several antistress compounds and to change their physiology, phenology, growth and reproduction in response to climate change. Rapid adaptation and microevolution occur at the population level. Together with these phenotypic and genotypic adaptations, the movement of organisms and the turnover of populations can lead to migration toward habitats with better conditions unless hindered by barriers. Both migration and local extinction of populations have occurred. However, many unknowns for all these processes remain. The roles of phenotypic plasticity and genotypic evolution and their possible trade-offs and links with population structure warrant further research. The application of omic techniques to ecological studies will greatly favor this research. It remains poorly understood how climate change will result in asymmetrical responses of species and how it will interact with other increasing global impacts, such as N eutrophication, changes in environmental N:P ratios and species invasion, among many others.

The albedo difference between snow-covered and snow-free tundra is high. Earlier studies have shown that taller and denser vegetation causes earlier snowmelt, and that shrub height and abundance, as well as the total biomass in summer reindeer pastures are lower than in winter pastures. Therefore, reindeer summer grazing could eventually delay the snowmelt and decrease the absorbed solar energy on the ground. The effect of reindeer summer grazing on the vegetation, snowmelt timing, surface albedo and ground heating is investigated in this study by comparing summer and non-summer pastures in the northern tundra areas of Fennoscandia. A comparison of vegetation types, NDVI, fractional snow cover and albedo between the Finnish year-round (including summer) pastures and the Norwegian non-summer (winter or spring/autumn) pastures is performed. Other factors influencing the snowmelt, such as surface air temperature, ground elevation and incoming solar radiation are taken into account. Information about the vegetation on the ground is based on a vegetation map compiled from Landsat TM/ETM + satellite data and ancillary map information. The NDVI, snowmelt and albedo analyses are performed using multi-temporal remote sensing data such as GlobSnow SE and MODIS based NDVI, snow and albedo products. The results here support previous studies and indicate that vegetation in the summer pastures is shorter and sparser and that snowmelt there occurs later than in the more densely vegetated, non-summer pastures. More shrubs protruding above the snowpack and earlier snowmelt on the Norwegian side lower the albedo during the snowmelt season. This causes higher solar energy absorption of up to 6 W/m(2) in the snowmelt season and contributes up to 0.5 W/m(2) to the yearly energy balance. Therefore this study suggests that summer reindeer herding can be used to delay snowmelt, increase surface albedo and to decrease the ground heating in the snowmelt season. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of fires on GPP is spatially heterogeneous, which is difficult to evaluate by limited point-based comparisons or is insufficient to assess by satellite vegetation index. The direct prefire and postfire comparison is widely used, but the recovery identification may become biased due to interannual climate variability. The objective of this study is to propose a method to quantify the spatially explicit GPP change caused by fires and succession. We collected three Landsat images acquired on 13 July 2004,5 August 2004, and 6 September 2004 to examine the GPP recovery of burned area from 1987 to 2004. A prefire Landsat image acquired in 1986 was used to reconstruct satellite images assuming that the fires of 1987-2004 had not occurred. We used a light-use efficiency model to estimate the GPP. This model was driven by maximum light-use efficiency (E-max) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (F-PAR). We applied this model to two scenarios (i.e., an actual postfire scenario and an assuming-no-fire scenario), where the changes in E-max and F-PAR were taken into account. The changes in E-max were represented by the change in land cover of evergreen needleleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, and shrub/grass mixed, whose E-max was determined from three fire chronosequence flux towers as 1.1556, 13336, and 0.5098 gC/MJ PAR. The changes in F-PAR were inferred from NDVI change between the actual postfire NDVI and the reconstructed NDVI. After GPP quantification for July, August, and September 2004, we calculated the difference between the two scenarios in absolute and percent GPP changes. Our results showed rapid recovery of GPP post-fire with a 24% recovery immediately after burning and 43% one year later. For the fire scars with an age range of 2-17 years, the recovery rate ranged from 54% to 95%. In addition to the averaging, our approach further revealed the spatial heterogeneity of fire impact on GPP, allowing one to examine the spatially explicit GPP change caused by fires.

The main channel of this gravel-bed river frequently avulses and possesses an anabranching plan form. Fluvial processes were interactive with life history processes of riparian plants in determining initial stages of primary succession. Reproductive strategies and herbivory became important factors later in succession. We conducted plant age and compositional surveys to assess patterns of propagule deposition. We found that dispersal strategies of species were an important factor influencing recruitment patterns. Flood-dispersed seeds resulted in even-aged cohorts of species persistently segregated in space, based on age data. Sediment characteristics and inundation potential had little influence on seedling distributions. Recruitment was also segregated on the basis of dispersal strategy. At the heads of bars, where vegetative propagules (live drift wood) were entombed during floods, the distributions of species were random. This size-selective nature of recruitment persisted through time. Vegetation age and distribution patterns were further diversified by the river's legacy of gravel deposition that diversified the primary successional pathway: one associated with ridges and another with swales. Interactions between these pathways and beaver herbivory initiated secondary succession. We used satellite imagery to quantify the extent of floodplain influenced by herbivory and to assess the importance of this driver of secondary succession. We also used high-resolution aerial imagery and randomly selected sites to provide an unbiased analysis. We classified this imagery to quantify the spatial extent of herbivory and its influence on the initiation of secondary succession. The results showed, in addition to recruitment and successional dynamics, the flood-plain habitat mosaic was diversified by the initiation of secondary succession. Patch and species composition within the vegetation mosaics were significantly different than those portions of the floodplain engaged in primary succession.

The spatial patterns of key phenological parameters were highly heterogeneous along the latitudinal gradients based on multi-satellite data. There was earlier SOS (start of the growing season), later EOS (end of the growing season), longer LOS (length of the growing season), and greater MaxNDVI from north to south in the region. The results based on MODIS and VGT data showed similar trends in phenological changes from 2000 to 2010, while quite a different trend was found based on AVHRR data from 2000 to 2008. A significantly delayed EOS (p < 0.01), thus increasing the LOS, was found from AVHRR data, while no similar trends were detected from MODIS and VGT data. There were no obvious shifts in MaxNDVI during the last decade. MODIS and VGT data were considered to be preferred data for monitoring vegetation phenology in northern high latitudes. Temperature is still a key factor controlling spatial phenological gradients and variability, while anthropogenic factors (reindeer husbandry and resource exploitation) might explain the delayed SOS in southern Yamal.

Methods: Multivariate analyses of the relationship between patch configuration of tall shrubs and diversity of adjacent herbaceous vegetation, across two tundra river catchments in Norway. Results: Configuration of shrub patches was clearly related to and diversity of adjacent herbaceous vegetation, independent of concurrent herbivore abundance (estimated from faeces during the study), or growing conditions. Highly-shredded shrub patches (i.e. fragmented patches with high edge density) were associated with grazing-tolerant species and low species richness. Conversely, little-shredded tall shrub patches were associated with grazing-sensitive shrub saplings. This indicates change in herbivory on a timescale longer than that covered by our faeces data.

Thickets of tall shrubs represent a conspicuous vegetation state in northern and temperate ecosystems, where it serves important ecological functions, including habitat for wildlife. Thickets are however labile, as tall shrubs respond rapidly to both abiotic and biotic environmental drivers. Our aim was to assess how large-scale spatial variation in willow thicket areal extent, configuration and habitat structure affected bird abundance, occupancy rates and species richness so as to provide an empirical basis for predicting the outcome of environmental change for riparian tundra bird communities. Based on a 4-year count data series, obtained through a large-scale study design in low arctic tundra in northern Norway, statistical hierarchical community models were deployed to assess relations between habitat configuration and bird species occupancy and community richness. We found that species abundance, occupancy and richness were greatly affected by willow areal extent and configuration, habitat features likely to be affected by intense ungulate browsing as well as climate warming. In sum, total species richness was maximized in large and tall willow patches of small to intermediate degree of fragmentation. These community effects were mainly driven by responses in the occupancy rates of species depending on tall willows for foraging and breeding, while species favouring other vegetation states were not affected. In light of the predicted climate driven willow shrub encroachment in riparian tundra habitats, our study predicts that many bird species would increase in abundance, and that the bird community as a whole could become enriched. Conversely, in tundra regions where overabundance of large herbivores leads to decreased areal extent, reduced height and increased fragmentation of willow thickets, bird community richness and species-specific abundance are likely to be significantly reduced.",,,,"Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Henden, John-Andre/0000-0002-8825-1167",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,MAY 14,2013,8,5,,,,,,,e63312,10.1371/journal.pone.0063312,,,,,,,WOS:000319107400049,23691020,,,,09/09/2020,295,empirical,bird communities,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In this study, we used C-14 and Pb-210 dating to assess when organic matter was buried within non-sorted circles fields near Abisko in northern Sweden. In addition, we used aerial photos from 1959 and 2008 to detect eventual trends in cryogenic activities during this period. We found that organic matter from former organic horizons (stratigraphically intact or partly fragmented) corresponds to three major periods: 0-100 A. D., 900-1250 A. D., and 1650-1950 A. D. The latter two periods were indicated by several dated samples, while the extent of the oldest period is more uncertainty (indicated by only one sample). The aerial photos suggest a net overgrowth by shrub vegetation of previously exposed mineral soil surfaces since 1959. This overgrowth trend was seen in most of the studied fields (92 out of 137 analyzed fields), indicating that the cryogenic activity has mainly decreased in studied non-sorted circles fields since the 1950s. This latter interpretation is also supported by the absence of buried organic layers formed during the last decades. We suggest that the organic matter was buried during the transition from longer cold periods to warmer conditions. We believe these climatic shifts could have triggered regional scale burial of soil organic matter and thus affected how these soils sequestered carbon. Citation: Becher, M., C. Olid, and J.

How these C-rich ecosystems will respond to future climate change, however, is still poorly understood. Furthermore, many northern peatlands exist in regions underlain by permafrost, adding to the challenge of projecting C balance under changing climate and permafrost dynamics. In this study, we used a paleoecological approach to examine the effect of past climates and local disturbances on vegetation and C accumulation at a peatland complex on the southern Seward Peninsula, Alaska over the past similar to 15 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP). We analyzed two cores about 30 m apart, NL10-1 (from a permafrost peat plateau) and NL10-2 (from an adjacent thermokarst collapse-scar bog), for peat organic matter (OM), C accumulation rates, macrofossil, pollen and grain size analysis. A wet rich fen occurred during the initial stages of peatland development at the thermokarst site (NL10-2). The presence of tree pollen from Picea spp. and Larix laricinia at 13.5-12.1 ka indicates a warm regional climate, corresponding with the well-documented Bolling-Allerod warm period. A cold and dry climate interval at 12.1-11.1 ka is indicated by the disappearance of tree pollen and increase in Poaceae pollen and an increase in woody material, likely representing a local expression of the Younger Dryas (YD) event. Following the YD, the warm Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) is characterized by the presence of Populus pollen, while the presence of Sphagnum spp. and increased C accumulation rates suggest high peatland productivity under a warm climate. Toward the end of the HTM and throughout the mid-Holocene a wet climate-induced several major flooding disturbance events at 10 ka, 8.1 ka, 6 ka, 5.4 ka and 4.7 ka, as evidenced by decreases in OM, and increases in coarse sand abundance and aquatic fossils (algae Chara and water fleas Daphnia). The initial peatland at permafrost site (NL10-1) is characterized by rapid C accumulation (66 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), high OM content and a peak in Sphagnum spp. at 5.8-4.6 ka, suggesting the lack of permafrost. A transition to extremely low C accumulation rates of 6.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) after 4.5 ka at this site suggests the onset of permafrost aggradation, likely in response to Neoglacial climate cooling as documented across the circum-Arctic region. A similar decrease in C accumulation rates also occurred at non-permafrost site NL10-2. Time-weighted C accumulation rates are 21.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for core NL10-1 during the last similar to 6.5 ka and 14.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for core NL10-2 during the last similar to 15 ka. Evidence from peat-core analysis and historical aerial photographs shows an abrupt increase in Sphagnum spp. and decrease in area of thermokarst lakes over the last century, suggesting major changes in hydrology and ecosystem structure, likely due to recent climate warming. Our results show that the thermokarst-permafrost complex was much more dynamic with high C accumulation rates under warmer climates in the past, while permafrost was stabilized and C accumulation slowed down following the Neoglacial cooling in the late Holocene. Furthermore, permafrost presence at local scales is controlled by both regional climate and site-specific factors, highlighting the challenge in projecting responses of permafrost peatlands and their C dynamics to future climate change.

Climate change is predicted to bring about warmer air temperatures, greater snow accumulation and northward movements of the shrub and tree lines. Understanding the responses of northern environments to changes in snow and growing-season land surface characteristics requires: (1) insights into the present-day linkages between snow and growing-season land surface characteristics; and (2) the ability to continue to monitor these associations over time across the vast pan-Arctic. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the pan-Arctic (north of 60 degrees N) linkages between two temporally distinct data products created from AMSR-E satellite passive microwave observations: GlobSnow snow water equivalent (SWE), and NTSG growing-season AMSR-E Land Parameters (air temperature, soil moisture and vegetation transmissivity). Due to the complex and interconnected nature of processes determining snow and growing-season land surface characteristics, these associations were analyzed using the modern nonparametric technique of alternating conditional expectations (ACE), as this approach does not impose a predefined analytic form. Findings indicate that regions with lower vegetation transmissivity (more biomass) at the start and end of the growing season tend to accumulate less snow at the start and end of the snow season, possibly due to interception and sublimation. Warmer air temperatures at the start and end of the growing season were associated with diminished snow accumulation at the start and end of the snow season. High latitude sites with warmer mean annual growing-season temperatures tended to accumulate more snow, probably due to the greater availability of water vapor for snow season precipitation at warmer locations. Regions with drier soils preceding snow onset tended to accumulate greater quantities of snow, likely because drier soils freeze faster and more thoroughly than wetter soils. Understanding and continuing to monitor these linkages at the regional scale using the ACE approach can allow insights to be gained into the complex response of Arctic ecosystems to climate-driven shifts in air temperature, vegetation, soil moisture and snow accumulation.",,,,,"Lin, John/0000-0003-2794-184X; Kelly, Richard/0000-0001-8076-7604",,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2013,10,11,,,,,7575,7597,,10.5194/bg-10-7575-2013,,,,,,,WOS:000327814700055,,,,,09/09/2020,298,empirical,snow cover patterns,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

The present-day vegetation in each square metre was analysed, revealing a community of Larix, shrubby Betula, and Salix on the polygon rim, a dominance of Carex and Andromeda polifolia in the rim-to-pond transition zone, and a predominantly monospecific Scorpidium scorpioides coverage within the pond. The total organic carbon (TOC) content, TOC/TN (total nitrogen) ratio, grain size, vascular plant macrofossils, moss remains, diatoms, and pollen were analysed for two vertical sections and a sediment core from a transect across the polygon. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the formation of the polygon started at least 1500 yr ago; the general positions of the pond and rim have not changed since that time. Two types of pond vegetation were identified, indicating two contrasting development stages of the polygon. The first was a well-established moss association, dominated by submerged or floating Scorpidium scorpioides and/or Drepanocladus spp. and overgrown by epiphytic diatoms such as Tabellaria flocculosa and Eunotia taxa. This stage coincides temporally with a period in which the polygon was only drained by lateral subsurface water flow, as indicated by mixed grain sizes. A different moss association occurred during times of repeated river flooding (indicated by homogeneous medium-grained sand that probably accumulated during the annual spring snowmelt), characterized by an abundance of Meesia triquetra and a dominance of benthic diatoms (e. g. Navicula vulpina), indicative of a relatively high pH and a high tolerance of disturbance. A comparison of the local polygon vegetation (inferred from moss and macrofossil spectra) with the regional vegetation (inferred from pollen spectra) indicated that the moss association with Scorpidium scorpioides became established during relatively favourable climatic conditions, while the association dominated by Meesia triquetra occurred during periods of harsh climatic conditions.

Are the patterns thus generated consistent with existing data? Features of the model: Rosenzweig-type predator-prey model, with lemmings interacting with depletable plants and herbaceous plants. The impact of marine-subsidized predators is included as an extra mortality factor, influencing lemmings in summer. Ranges of parameters: We set the carrying capacity of depletable plants at 2000 kg.ha(-1). We used carrying capacities for herbaceous plants of 1000 kg.ha(-1) (grassland/meadow) and 100 kg.ha(-1) (heath). In the absence of predation, we assume that the population growth rate of lemmings in summer is zero when their foraging rate is 44% of the saturation rate. In subsequent simulations, we successively increased the foraging rate required for a zero population growth rate to simulate the impact of a successively larger pool of marine-subsidized predators. Predictions: On grassland/meadow tundra, increasing intensity of summer predation reduces the amplitude and period of lemming and plant oscillations and increases the minimum and average density of lemmings and depletable plants. The predicted predator-lemming relationship is thus mutualistic rather than exploitative. In heath-type tundra, the predicted positive impact of summer predation on lemmings is even stronger because, without intense summer predation, the predicted oscillations are violent enough to lead to local extinctions. In tundra areas with such dynamics, natural selection should favour lemmings that react to high population densities by emigrating.",,,,"Hoset, Katrine S./A-5090-2010","Hoset, Katrine S./0000-0002-1371-012X",,,,,,,,,,,,1522-0613,1937-3791,,,,JAN,2013,15,1,,,,,1,24,,,,,,,,,WOS:000322366100001,,,,,09/09/2020,300,empirical,lemming population dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

This shift has the potential to alter the surface energy balance through changes to the surface albedo, snow accumulation and melt, and ground thermal regimes. However, to date there have been few quantitative estimates of the rate of tall shrub expansion. We used soft copy stereo visualization of air photos to map fine-scale changes in tall shrub tundra and green alder density in the upland tundra north of Inuvik, NT between 1972 and 2004. We also used 2004 photos to map tall shrub tundra in areas affected by fires that occurred between 1960 and 1968. To assess the potential impact of vegetation change on microclimate, we used pyranometers to measure albedo and net solar radiation, thermistors attached to data loggers to record ground temperatures, and field surveys to record winter snow conditions in three common vegetation types. Fine-scale mapping shows that green alder stem density has increased by 68% (+/- 24.1) since 1972. Average tall shrub tundra cover has also increased by 15% (+/- 3.6) since 1972. Historical tundra fires had the highest proportion of tall shrub cover of all areas mapped using 2004 photos, ranging from 92 to 99%. Based on these results, we suggest that predicted increases in the size and frequency of tundra fire are likely to drive rapid shrub proliferation in the Low Arctic. Shrub-dominated sites have decreased albedo, increased net solar radiation, deeper snow pack, and elevated near-surface ground temperatures, indicating that continued increases in shrub cover will affect regional climate, hydrology, permafrost temperatures, and terrain stability.",,,,"Lantz, Trevor/J-1163-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,JAN,2013,16,1,,,,,47,59,,10.1007/s10021-012-9595-2,,,,,,,WOS:000314024900004,,,,,09/09/2020,301,empirical,shrub expansion,cover change,"Nunavik, CA",133.5,-168.75,remote sensing,temperature; fire,abiotic,Alnus viridis,unknown,landscape,,WOS search

The changes in plant abundance and chemistry might have cascading effects on tundra food webs, but an integrated understanding of how the responses vary between habitats and across environmental gradients is lacking. We assessed responses in plant abundance and plant chemistry to warmer climate, both at species and community levels, in two different habitats. We used a long-term and multisite warming (OTC) experiment in the Scandinavian forest-tundra ecotone to investigate (i) changes in plant community composition and (ii) responses in foliar nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon-based secondary compound concentrations in two dominant evergreen dwarf-shrubs (Empetrum hermaphroditum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and two deciduous shrubs (Vaccinium myrtillus and Betula nana). We found that initial plant community composition, and the functional traits of these plants, will determine the responsiveness of the community composition, and thus community traits, to experimental warming. Although changes in plant chemistry within species were minor, alterations in plant community composition drive changes in community-level nutrient concentrations. In view of projected climate change, our results suggest that plant abundance will increase in the future, but nutrient concentrations in the tundra field layer vegetation will decrease. These effects are large enough to have knock-on consequences for major ecosystem processes like herbivory and nutrient cycling. The reduced food quality could lead to weaker trophic cascades and weaker top down control of plant community biomass and composition in the future.

In the communities with adult plants of G. pannonica, we recorded environmental variables (the slope, the altitude, and the covers of bare ground, litter, and rocks), estimated parameters of the vegetation (the covers of herbs, bryophytes, and dwarf shrubs), and counted the seedlings of G. pannonica. In a field experiment, we investigated seedling survival under different soil moisture regimes. We also observed seasonal dynamics of seedling recruitment in permanent plots over the course of three years. In the primary habitats of both regions, G. pannonica grew in a relatively wide range of communities, and its seedlings occurred in each area. In the secondary habitats of the Bohemian Forest, a very low frequency of the seedlings was recorded. The number of seedlings increased with the covers of the moss layer and of bare soil and decreased with the cover of the herb layer, especially of graminoids. The seedling mortality was significantly lower in the plots with higher soil moistures, and the emergence of new-born seedlings was concentrated in the spring season, when the soil received a high water supply due to melting of snow. For the successful generative reproduction of G. pannonica, our findings highlight the critical importance of the microsites with low levels of competition and of sufficient soil moisture G. pannonica. It seems that because of the long-term lack of grazing disturbances, the structures of the secondary habitats of G. pannonica in the Bohemian Forest have become unfavourable for seedling establishment and generative reproduction of this threatened species.

These permafrost ecosystems have supported humans for more than 4500 years, and are currently home to ca. 115,000 people, the majority of whom are First Nations, Inuit and M,tis. The responses of these ecosystems to the regional warming over the past 30-50 years were the focus of four Canadian IPY projects. Northern residents and researchers reported changes in climate and weather patterns and noted shifts in vegetation and other environmental variables. In forest-tundra areas tree growth and reproductive effort correlated with temperature, but seedling establishment was often hindered by other factors resulting in site-specific responses. Increased shrub cover has occurred in sites across the Arctic at the plot and landscape scale, and this was supported by results from experimental warming. Experimental warming increased vegetation cover and nutrient availability in most tundra soils; however, resistance to warming was also found. Soil microbial diversity in tundra was no different than in other biomes, although there were shifts in mycorrhizal diversity in warming experiments. All sites measured were sinks for carbon during the growing season, with expected seasonal and latitudinal patterns. Modeled responses of a mesic tundra system to climate change showed that the sink status will likely continue for the next 50-100 years, after which these tundra systems will likely become a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. These IPY studies were the first comprehensive assessment of the state and change in Canadian northern terrestrial ecosystems and showed that the inherent variability in these systems is reflected in their site-specific responses to changes in climate.

We investigated the associations between browsing, tundra shrub canopies and their understory vegetation by utilizing a long-term (1013 seasons) experiment controlling reindeer and ptarmigan herbivory in the subarctic forest tundra ecotone in northwestern Fennoscandia. In this area, there has also been a consistent increase in the yearly thermal sum and precipitation during the study period. The cover of shrubs increased 2.87.8 fold in exclosures and these contrasted with browsed control areas creating a sharp gradient of canopy cover of tundra shrubs across a variety of vegetation types. Browsing exclusions caused significant shifts in more productive vegetation types, whereas little or no shift occurred in low-productive tundra communities. The increased deciduous shrub cover was associated with significant losses of understory plant species and shifts in functional composition, the latter being clearest in the most productive plant community types. The total cover of understory vegetation decreased along with increasing shrub cover, while the cover of litter showed the opposite response. The cover of cryptogams decreased along with increasing shrub cover, while the cover of forbs was favoured by a shrub cover. Increasing shrub cover decreased species richness of understory vegetation, which was mainly due to the decrease in the cryptogam species. The effects were consistent across different types of forest tundra vegetation indicating that shrub increase may have broad impacts on arctic vegetation diversity. Deciduous shrub cover is strongly regulated by reindeer browsing pressure and altered browsing pressure may result in a profound shrub expansion over the next one or two decades. Results suggest that the impact of an increase in shrubs on tundra plant richness is strong and browsing pressure effectively counteracts the effects of climate warming-driven shrub expansion and hence maintains species richness.",,,,"Virtanen, Risto/G-1810-2010","Virtanen, Risto/0000-0002-8295-8217",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,OCT,2012,121,10,,,,,1544,1552,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.20115.x,,,,,,,WOS:000308634600005,,,,,09/09/2020,306,empirical,vegetation change,cover,"Mt Muotkantakka, FI",69.117,20.75,herbivore exclusion; vegetation surveys,herbivory; vegetation type,biotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

Earlier work on Arctic vegetation highlighted the role of summer sea ice decline in the enhanced warming and greening phenomena observed in the region, but did not contain enough details for spatially characterizing the interactions between sea ice, temperature and vegetation photosynthetic absorption. By using 1 km resolution data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) as a primary data source, this study presents detailed maps of vegetation and temperature trends for the Siberian Arctic region, using the time integrated normalized difference vegetation index (TI-NDVI) and summer warmth index (SWI) calculated for the period 2000-11 to represent vegetation greenness and temperature respectively. Spatio-temporal relationships between the two indices and summer sea ice conditions were investigated with transects at eight locations using sea ice concentration data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I). In addition, the derived vegetation and temperature trends were compared among major Arctic vegetation types and bioclimate subzones. The fine resolution trend map produced confirms the overall greening (+1% yr(-1)) and warming (+0.27% yr(-1)) of the region, reported in previous studies, but also reveals browning areas. The causes of such local decreases in vegetation, while surrounding areas are experiencing the opposite reaction to changing conditions, are still unclear. Overall correlations between sea ice concentration and SWI as well as TI-NDVI decreased in strength with increasing distance from the coast, with a particularly pronounced pattern in the case of SWI. SWI appears to be driving TI-NDVI in many cases, but not systematically, highlighting the presence of limiting factors other than temperature for plant growth in the region. Further unravelling those limiting factors constitutes a priority in future research.

In Arctic environments the parameters controlling these processes are not well understood. We measured soil GHG concentrations and surface fluxes from six vegetation communities at a High Arctic polar oasis and adjacent polar deserts in order to identify regions within the soil profile of production and consumption of CO2, CH4, and N2O. Examined communities included two polar deserts differing in parent material and soil pH, and four lowland tundra communities: prostrate dwarf-shrub, herb tundra, prostrate/hemiprostrate dwarf-shrub tundra, nontussock sedge, dwarf-shrub, moss tundra and a sedge/grass, moss wetland, representative of large areas at lower Arctic latitudes. Polar desert soils were net producers of greenhouse gases during the brief High Arctic growing season, including at depths close to the permafrost layer, and effluxes from the surface were of a similar magnitude to nearby mesic and hydric tundra soils including for CO2, indicative of soil respiration in desert soils with few roots. Differences in water content, rather than calculated diffusivity, appear to drive gas transport in at least some soils, with all three GHG appearing to move rapidly through, for example, the soil at 10 cm above permafrost in the Prostrate (dominated by Dryas integrifolia) plant community.

Methods We re-survey plots first described in a phytosociological study of 19561958 to assess the changes in plant species composition over the last 50 yr in five major upland vegetation types. Using a combination of multivariate analysis, dissimilarity measures, diversity metrics and published data on species attributes; we quantify, characterize and link potential drivers of environmental change with the observed changes in species composition. Results Grassland and heath vegetation declined in species richness and variation in community composition, while mires showed little change. Previously distinct vegetation types became more similar in composition, characterized by the increased dominance of generalist upland graminoids and reduced dwarf-shrub, forb and lichen cover, although novel assemblages were not apparent. Species with an oceanic distribution increased at the expense of those with an arctic-montane distribution. Temperature, precipitation and acidity were found to be potentially important in explaining changes in species composition: species that had undergone the greatest increases had a preference for warmer, drier and more acidic conditions. Conclusions The vegetation of the northwest Scottish Highlands has undergone marked biotic homogenization over the last 50 yr, manifested through a loss of various aspects of diversity at the local, community and landscape scales. The magnitude of change varies between vegetation types, although the nature of change shows many similar characteristics.

The observed changes were statistically evaluated using restricted permutation tests and were compared for the two time scales considered using Pearson correlation tests. Results Total number of species did not significantly change over the two time periods considered. One species (Botrychium lunaria) was found new to the island.

The reduction in albedo associated with shrub-induced 'greening' of the tundra is predicted to cause significant positive feedbacks to regional warming. Enhanced soil fertility arising from climate change is expected to be the primary mechanism driving shrub responses, yet our overall understanding of the relative importance of soil nitrogen ( N) and phosphorus ( P) availability and the significance of other ecological drivers is constrained by experiments with varying treatments, sites, and durations. We investigated dwarf birch apical stem growth responses to a wide range of ecological factors ( enhanced summer temperatures, deepened snow, caribou exclusion, factorial high level nitrogen and phosphorus additions, and low level nitrogen additions) after six years of experimental manipulations in birch hummock tundra. As expected, birch apical stem growth was more strongly enhanced by the substantial increases in nutrient supply than by our changes in any of the other ecological factors. The factorial additions revealed that P availability was at least as important as that of N, and our low N additions demonstrated that growth was unresponsive to moderate increases in soil nitrogen alone. Experimental warming increased apical stem growth 2.5-fold-considerably more than in past studies-probably due to the relatively strong effect of our greenhouses on soil temperature.

The soil associated with these plant communities contain quantitatively and qualitatively different forms of soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrient availability that drive changes in biogeochemical cycling rates. Therefore different boreal plant communities likely contain different soil biotic communities which in turn affect rates of organic matter decomposition. We examined relationships between plant communities, microbial communities, enchytraeids, and soil C turnover in near-surface soils along a shallow topographic soil moisture and vegetation gradient in interior Alaska. We tested the hypothesis that as soil moisture increases along the gradient, surface soils would become increasingly dominated by bacteria and mesofauna and have more rapid rates of C turnover. We utilized bomb radiocarbon techniques to infer rates of C turnover and the C-13 isotopic composition of SUM and respired CO2 to infer the degree of soil humification. Soil phenol oxidase and peroxidase enzyme activities were generally higher in the rich fen compared with the forest and bog birch sites. Results indicated greater C fluxes and more rapid C turnover in the surface soils of the fen sites compared to the wetland forest and shrub sites. Quantitative PCR analyses of soil bacteria and archaea, combined with enchytraeid counts, indicated that surface soils from the lowland fen ecosystems had higher abundances of these microbial and mesofaunal groups. Fungal abundance was highly variable and not significantly different among sites. Microbial data was utilized in a food web model that confirmed that rapidly cycling systems are dominated by bacterial activity and enchytraeid grazing. However, our results also suggest that oxidative enzymes play an important role in the C mineralization process in saturated systems, which has been often ignored.

The Exploitation Ecosystem Hypothesis (EEH) posited that as aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) increases, the additional biomass should support higher trophic levels. We developed an extension of EEH to include the impacts of increases in ANPP on belowground consumers in a similar manner as aboveground, but indirectly through changes in the allocation of photosynthate to roots. We tested our predictions for plants aboveground and for phytophagous nematodes and their predators belowground in two common arctic tundra plant communities subjected to 11 years of increased soil nutrient availability and/or exclusion of mammalian herbivores. The less productive dry heath (DH) community met the predictions of EEH aboveground, with the greatest ANPP and plant biomass in the fertilized plots protected from herbivory. A palatable grass increased in fertilized plots while dwarf evergreen shrubs and lichens declined. Belowground, phytophagous nematodes also responded as predicted, achieving greater biomass in the higher ANPP plots, whereas predator biomass tended to be lower in those same plots (although not significantly). In the higher productivity moist acidic tussock (MAT) community, aboveground responses were quite different. Herbivores stimulated ANPP and biomass in both ambient and enriched soil nutrient plots; maximum ANPP occurred in fertilized plots exposed to herbivory. Fertilized plots became dominated by dwarf birch (a deciduous shrub) and cloudberry (a perennial forb); under ambient conditions these two species coexist with sedges, evergreen dwarf shrubs, and Sphagnum mosses. Phytophagous nematodes did not respond significantly to changes in ANPP, although predator biomass was greatest in control plots. The contrasting results of these two arctic tundra plant communities suggest that the predictions of EEH may hold for very low ANPP communities, but that other factors, including competition and shifts in vegetation composition toward less palatable species, may confound predicted responses to changes in productivity in higher ANPP communities such as the MAT studied here.",,,,"Moore, John/E-9802-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JUL,2012,93,7,,,,,1683,1694,,10.1890/11-1631.1,,,,,,,WOS:000306829300019,22919914,,,,09/09/2020,317,empirical,vegetation and soil invertebrate dynamics,abundance,"North Alaska, US",68.2,-149.6,factorial experiment,fertilisation; herbivore exclusion,biotic; abiotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

Migratory barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) rely heavily on terricolous lichens to sustain them through the winter months. Lichens preferred by caribou can take 50 or more years to recover after being consumed by wildfires. We simulated effects of climate change on the fire regime within the winter range of one of the largest caribou herds in the world, the Western Arctic Herd, to assess how their forage may be impacted. We forecast that the total area burned (AB) in the near term (2008-2053) will be 0-30% greater than during our historic reference period (1950-2007) depending on the climate model (CGCM3.1 or ECHAM5) considered. Further into the future (i.e., 2054-2099), we forecast AB to increase 25-53% more than during our reference period. In contrast to the entire study area, which contains both tundra and boreal forest habitats, we forecast that the amount of AB in tundra alone will increase (0-61%) in the near term. Simulated high-quality caribou winter range, as indexed by tundra and spruce habitat that had not burned in >= 50 years, decreased modestly (<6%) in the near term over the entire study area. Simulated changes were more dramatic within the herd's core winter range, with declines in high-quality caribou winter range approaching 30%. Conversely, moose habitat was projected to increase by 19-64% within the core winter range in the near term. The simulated declines in the quantity of core winter range in the future due to larger and more frequent fires could impact caribou abundance through decreased nutritional performance and/or apparent competition with moose. These impacts would likely be detrimental to the subsistence users that rely on this resource. Additionally, changes in the fire regime and decreases in caribou abundance could amplify feedback mechanisms, such as decreasing albedo, by facilitating shrub growth that may hasten climate-driven changes to the composition and structure of vegetation communities in the low Arctic.",,,,,"joly, kyle/0000-0001-8420-7452",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,MAY,2012,3,5,,,,,,,36,10.1890/ES12-00012.1,,,,,,,WOS:000327301600001,,,,,09/09/2020,318,modelling,fire dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Bryophytes were less sensitive to experimental warming than lichens, but depending on the length of the gradient, bryophyte diversity decreased both with increasing temperatures and at extremely low temperatures. Among bryophytes, Sphagnum mosses were particularly resistant to experimental warming in terms of both abundance and diversity. Temperature, on both continents, was the main driver of species composition within experiments and along gradients, with the exception of the Swedish subarctic birch forest where amount of litter constituted the best explanatory variable. In a warming experiment in moist acidic tussock tundra in Alaska, temperature together with soil ammonium availability were the most important factors influencing species composition. Overall, dwarf shrub abundance (deciduous and evergreen) was positively related to warming but so were the bryophytes Sphagnum girgensohnii, Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi; the majority of other cryptogams showed a negative relationship to warming. This unique combination of intercontinental comparison, natural gradient studies and experimental studies shows that cryptogam diversity and abundance, especially within lichens, is likely to decrease under arctic climate warming. Given the many ecosystem processes affected by cryptogams in high latitudes (e.g. carbon sequestration, N2-fixation, trophic interactions), these changes will have important feedback consequences for ecosystem functions and climate.",,,,"Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014; Braak, Cajo J.

Extreme winter warming events in the Arctic rapidly melt snow and expose ecosystems to unseasonably warm air (210 similar to degrees C for 214 similar to days), but returning to cold winter climate exposes the ecosystem to lower temperatures by the loss of insulating snow. Soil animals, which play an integral part in soil processes, may be very susceptible to such events depending on the intensity of soil warming and low temperatures following these events. We simulated week-long extreme winter warming events using infrared heating lamps, alone or with soil warming cables for two consecutive years in a sub-Arctic dwarf shrub heathland. Minimum temperatures were lower and freeze-thaw cycles were 211 times more frequent in treatment plots compared with control plots. Following the second event, Acari populations decreased by 39%; primarily driven by declines of Prostigmata (69%) and the Mesostigmatic nymphs (74%). A community-weighted vertical stratification shift occurred from smaller soil dwelling (eu-edaphic) Collembola species dominance to larger litter dwelling (hemi-edaphic) species dominance in the canopy-with-soil warming plots compared with controls. The most susceptible groups to these winter warming events were the smallest individuals (Prostigmata and eu-edaphic Collembola). This was not apparent from abundance data at the Collembola taxon level, indicating that life forms and species traits play a major role in community assembly following extreme events. The observed shift in soil community can cascade down to the micro-flora affecting plant productivity and mineralization rates. Short-term extreme weather events have the potential to shift community composition through trait composition with potentially large consequences for ecosystem development.",,,,"Bokhorst, Stef/D-1858-2009; Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014","Bjerke, Jarle/0000-0003-2721-1492; Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107; Berg, Matty P./0000-0001-8442-8503",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,MAR,2012,18,3,,,,,1152,1162,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02565.x,,,,,,,WOS:000300671600029,,,,,09/09/2020,320,empirical,soil fauna community composition,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Here, we investigated the impact of the physical elements of the environment on shrub secondary growth by comparing annual growth rates of model species from similar habitats at contrasting altitude, microtopography, latitude, geographical location, and soil type, in both the sub- and High Arctic. We found that secondary growth has a modest sensitivity to the environment but with large differences among species. For example, the evergreen Cassiope tetragona is affected by altitude, microtopography, and latitude, whereas the evergreen Empetrum hermaphroditum has rather constant secondary growth in all environments. Deciduous species seem to be most affected by microtopography. Furthermore, the impact of the environment on secondary growth differed from the impact on primary growth (stem apical growth, stem length, and apical growth of stem plus leaves), in some cases even with opposite responses. Thus caution should be taken when estimating the impact of the environment on shrub growth from apical growth only.

Exclusion of caribou and muskoxen over the past 8 years has led to dramatic increases in shrub cover, leaf area, ecosystem photosynthesis, and a nearly threefold increase in net C uptake. These responses were accentuated by warming, but only in the absence of herbivores.

However, there is a lack of knowledge of biochemical backgrounds triggering ageing and consequently, rhizogenesis. Experiments with Prunus subhirtella 'Autumnalis' leafy cuttings of three different physiological ages (adult (over 40-year-old stock plants), semi-adult (5-year-old cutting plants) and juvenile (5-year-old in vitro plants)) were conducted in 2009. Half of the cuttings were banded ca. 3 cm above the bottom of the cutting with aluminum wire prior to insertion into the substrate to block the polar auxin transport. IBA, which was exogenously applied to the cuttings, could only be detected in the base of the cuttings on the first day after severance, juvenile cuttings tended to have the highest values, but the effect was age specific. Later, the detection was not possible, regardless of the age. The IAA profile in cutting bases was similar for all physiological ages, reaching the peak on the first day after severance. Juvenile cuttings, in which the stems had been banded before insertion, contained more IAA in their bases on day 1 compared to the stems, which were not banded. These cuttings presumably transported absorbed auxin mainly via phloem, and not via mass flow like semi-adult and adult cuttings, where IAA concentrations were similar or even greater in non-banded cuttings compared to banded ones. These cuttings also tended to exhibit the best rooting results. The IAA-Asp accumulation was especially strong in adult cuttings, which contained significantly more aspartate on the first and third days after severance when compared with semi-adult and juvenile cuttings.

We conducted an UV-B exclusion experiment in a dwarf shrub heath in NE Greenland (74 degrees N), with open control, filter control, UV-B filtering and UV-AB filtering, all in combination with leaf angle control. Two sites with natural leaf positions had ground angles 0 degrees ('level site') and 45 degrees ('sloping site'), while at a third site the leaves were fixed in an angle of 45 degrees to homogenize the irradiance dose ('fixed leaf angle site'). The photosynthetic performance of the leaves was characterized by simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and the PSII performance through the growing season was investigated with fluorescence measurements. Leaf harvest towards the end of the growing season was done to determine the specific leaf area and the content of carbon, nitrogen and UV-B absorbing compounds. Compared to a 60% reduced UV-B irradiance, the ambient solar UV-B reduced net photosynthesis in Salix arctica leaves fixed in the 45 degrees position which exposed leaves to maximum natural irradiance. Also a reduced Calvin Cycle capacity was found, i.e. the maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) and the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (V-cmax), and the PSII performance showed a decreased quantum yield and increased energy dissipation. A parallel response pattern and reduced PSII performance at all three sites indicate that these responses take place in all leaves across position in the vegetation.

Several attempts have been made to scrutinize the factors driving species loss following excess N input, but generalizations across sites or vegetation types cannot yet be made. Here we focus on the relative importance of the vegetation type, the local environment (climate, soil pH, wet deposition load) and the experimentally applied (cumulative) N dose on the response of the vegetation to N addition. Location Mainly North America and Europe. Methods We conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of in situ N addition experiments in different vegetation types, focusing on the response of biomass and species richness. Results Whereas the biomass of grasslands and salt marshes significantly increased with N fertilization, forest understorey vegetation, heathlands, freshwater wetlands and bogs did not show any significant response. Graminoids significantly increased in biomass following N addition, whereas bryophytes significantly lost biomass; shrubs, forbs and lichens did not significantly respond. The yearly N fertilization dose significantly influenced the biomass response of grassland and salt marshes, while for the other vegetation types none of the collected predictor variables were of significant influence. Species richness significantly decreased with N addition in grasslands and heathlands [Correction added on 23 March 2011, after first online publication: 'across all vegetation types' changed to 'in grasslands and heathlands']. The relative change in species richness following N addition was significantly driven by the cumulative N dose. Main conclusions The decline in species richness with cumulative N input follows a negative exponential pathway. Species loss occurs faster at low levels of cumulative N input or at the beginning of the addition, followed by an increasingly slower species loss at higher cumulative N inputs. These findings lead us to stress the importance of including the cumulative effect of N additions in calculations of critical load values.",,,,"Wuyts, Karen/E-3021-2012; De Frenne, Pieter/N-4969-2014","Wuyts, Karen/0000-0002-3371-6828; De Frenne, Pieter/0000-0002-8613-0943",,,,,,,,,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,NOV,2011,20,6,,,,,803,816,,10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00652.x,,,,,,,WOS:000296137400002,,,,,09/09/2020,325,meta-analysis,species diversity,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In a recent field manipulation experiment in which shrubs were removed from a plot and compared to a control plot with shrubs, Blok et al (2010 Glob. Change Biol. 16 1296-305) found that shrubs protect the ground through shading, resulting in a similar to 9% shallower active layer thickness (ALT) under shrubs compared to grassy-tundra, which led them to argue that continued Arctic shrub expansion could mitigate future permafrost thaw. We utilize the Community Land Model (CLM4) coupled to the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM4) to evaluate this hypothesis. CLM4 simulates shallower ALT (similar to - 11 cm) under shrubs, consistent with the field manipulation study. However, in an idealized pan-Arctic +20% shrub area experiment, atmospheric heating, driven mainly by surface albedo changes related to protrusion of shrub stems above the spring snowpack, leads to soil warming and deeper ALT (similar to + 10 cm). Therefore, if climate feedbacks are considered, shrub expansion may actually increase rather than decrease permafrost vulnerability. When we account for blowing-snow redistribution from grassy-tundra to shrubs, shifts in snowpack distribution in low versus high shrub area simulations counter the climate warming impact, resulting in a grid cell mean ALT that is unchanged. These results reinforce the need to consider vegetation dynamics and blowing-snow processes in the permafrost thaw model projections.",,,,"Lawrence, David/C-4026-2011","Lawrence, David/0000-0002-2968-3023",,,,,,,,,,,,1748-9326,,,,,OCT-DEC,2011,6,4,,,,,,,45504,10.1088/1748-9326/6/4/045504,,,,,,,WOS:000298674700060,,,,,09/09/2020,326,modelling,permafrost dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We then analyzed how temporal changes in productivity differed along an evergreen-deciduous gradient in boreal Alaska, along a shrub cover gradient in Arctic Alaska, and during succession after fire in boreal North America and northern Eurasia. We find that the earlier reported contrast between trends of increasing tundra and decreasing boreal forest productivity has amplified in recent years, particularly in North America. Decreases in boreal forest productivity are most prominent in areas of denser tree cover and, particularly in Alaska, evergreen forest stands. On the North Slope of Alaska, however, increases in tundra productivity do not appear restricted to areas of higher shrub cover, which suggests enhanced productivity across functional vegetation types.

In this work, we assessed how these factors affect the emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from three subarctic dwarf shrub species in a field experiment after 18 treatment years. Of the studied species the willow Salix phylicifolia L. was the only isoprene-emitter with an emission potential of 16.1 +/- 8.4 mu g g(-1) dw h(-1) (at 30 degrees C and photosynthetic photon flux density of 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The dwarf birch Betula nana L. had significant emissions of various reactive BVOCs, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The evergreen Cassiope tetragona (L) D. Don emitted high amounts of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Due to chance, the temperature in the warming treatment (employing open-top plastic tents) and the unwarmed treatments was similar at the time of the measurements, and therefore long-term indirect effects of warming could be assessed without interference of temperature differences at the time of measurement. The long-term warming had not altered foliar N, P or condensed tannin concentrations, but it had led to other chemical changes detected in the near-infrared reflectance spectra of the leaves. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in the BVOC emissions per unit leaf mass measured by the dynamic enclosure method and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Annual additions of NPK fertilizer, which mimicked increased nutrient availability, had accumulated P in the leaves of all species. In addition, fertilization marginally increased the leaf N concentration of B. nana. The only significant fertilization effect on BVOC emissions was a stimulation of emission of the sesquiterpene beta-selinene from S. phylicifolia. The shading treatment obtained by dome-shaped hessian tents did not cause clear long-term changes in leaf chemistry or BVOC emissions. The only observed change was a marginally significant increase in sesquiterpene emissions from B. nana. when the treatment effects on long-term biomass changes in the different treatments were taken into account by proportioning the BVOC emissions to the biomass of each species in the field treatments, warming led to a significant increase and shading to a decrease in the total BVOC emissions per unit ground area from B. nano.

We conducted an UV-B exclusion experiment in a dwarf shrub heath in NE Greenland (74 degrees N), with open control, filter control, UV-B filtering and UV-AB filtering, all in combination with leaf angle control. Two sites with natural leaf positions had ground angles of 0 degrees ('level site') and 45 degrees ('sloping site'), while at a third site the leaves were fixed in an angle of 45 to homogenize the irradiance dose ('fixed leaf angle site'). The photosynthetic performance of the leaves was characterized by simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and the PSII performance through the growing season was investigated with fluorescence measurements. Leaf harvest towards the end of the growing season was done to determine the specific leaf area and the content of carbon, nitrogen and UV-B absorbing compounds. Compared to a 60% reduced UV-B irradiance, the ambient solar UV-B reduced net photosynthesis in Salix arctica leaves fixed in the 45 degrees position which exposed leaves to maximum natural irradiance. Also a reduced Calvin Cycle capacity was found, i.e, the maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) and the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (V-cmax), and the PSII performance showed a decreased quantum yield and increased energy dissipation. A parallel response pattern and reduced PSII performance at all three sites indicate that these responses take place in all leaves across position in the vegetation. These findings add to the evidence that the ambient solar UV-B currently is a significant stress factor for plants in high Arctic Greenland. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A. & D. Love,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Pseudorchis albida (Small White Orchid) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to abiotic and biotic factors, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2. Pseudorchis albida is a native British herb growing in several plant communities of semi-natural habitats, typically in recently burned heather moorlands, upland well-drained pastures and meadows, and cliff ledges. Although the species is able to tolerate a wide range of ecological conditions from mildly acid to base-rich soils, it is limited mainly to open, short and nutrient-poor stands. Typical British plant communities include Calluna vulgaris heathlands, Anthoxanthum odoratum - Geranium sylvaticum hay meadows, and Nardus grasslands. The species often grows in transitions from heath to grass-dominated communities. The ecology of P. albida in the northern acidic environments is poorly understood. 3. Pseudorchis albida is a perennial geophyte whose populations are maintained predominantly by sexual reproduction, as vegetative spread is limited. The main perennating organ is a highly divided root tuber, which is completely replaced every year. Dormancy - the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons - has been observed and typically lasts for one, sometimes 2 years. The adventitious roots and distal parts of the root tuber are colonized by basidiomycetes from the family Tulasnellaceae. 4. The species is pollinated by crepuscular pyralid and pterophorid moths, most likely attracted by the sweet scent. During the day, pollinia can be also transferred by dance flies (Empididae). The breeding system of P. albida is poorly known but high fruit set, often over 90%, raises the possibility of spontaneous autogamy, particularly in arctic-alpine areas. The probability of flowering in consecutive years in P. albida is strongly influenced by cost of flowering and fruiting. 5. Pseudorchis albida has suffered a significant decline in distribution in Britain and other European countries. In Britain, it has been lost from more than 65% of its historical sites, particularly in lowland areas. The main causal factors are the cessation of traditional agricultural practices, habitat fragmentation and disturbance associated with housing and road construction, and agricultural improvement, including reclamation, fertilization and overgrazing. Conservation of remnant populations primarily depends on the maintenance of a short turf by extensive grazing, controlled burning and shrub cutting to promote flowering of adult plants and seedling recruitment.",,,,,"Jersakova, Jana/0000-0003-0169-801X; Dotterl, Stefan/0000-0001-5228-1332; Tesitelova, Tamara/0000-0001-6901-6359",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,,,,,SEP,2011,99,5,,,,,1282,1298,,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01868.x,,,,,,,WOS:000294013800021,,,,,09/09/2020,332,empirical,orchid demography,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In Arctic tundra, near Toolik Lake, Alaska, we quantified net N-mineralization rates under ambient and manipulated snow treatments at three different plant communities that varied in abundance of deciduous shrubs. Our objective was twofold: (1) to test whether the amount of snow that can accumulate around Arctic deciduous shrubs maintains winter soil temperatures high enough to stimulate microbial activity and increase soil N levels (effect of soil microclimate) and (2) to compare the relative effects of snow versus shrubs on N availability via effects on the main drivers of N-mineralization: SOM quality versus microclimate. Winter snow addition had a positive effect on summer, but not winter, N-mineralization rates. Soil organic matter quality had a nine times larger effect on N-mineralization than did soil microclimate in the summer season and only SOM quality had a detectable effect on N-mineralization in the winter. Here we conclude that on a short time scale, shrub interactions with snow may play a role in increasing plant available N, primarily through effects on the summer soil microenvironment. In addition, differences in SOM quality can drive larger differences in net N-mineralization than changes in soil microclimate of the magnitude of what we saw across our three sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,AUG,2011,14,5,,,,,804,817,,10.1007/s10021-011-9447-5,,,,,,,WOS:000292813800010,,,,,09/09/2020,333,empirical,nitrogen mineralisation,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

An understanding of the direct and indirect theoretical causal relationships between key intercorrelated variables that drive the process of N-2-fixation is essential to understanding N input. An exploratory multi-group Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of soil moisture, plant community functional composition, and bryophyte and lichen abundance on rates of nitrogen fixation at a low arctic ecosystem, two high arctic oases and a high arctic polar desert in the Canadian Arctic. Increasing soil moisture was strongly associated with an increasing presence of bryophytes and increasing bryophyte abundance was a major factor determining higher N-2-fixation rates at all sites. Shrubs had a negative effect on bryophyte abundance at all sites with the exception of the polar desert site at Alexandra Fjord highland. The importance of competition from vascular plants appears to be greater in more productive sites and may increase at lower latitudes.

However, use of this C source in stream food webs often is viewed as insignificant because of its relatively slow breakdown rates and low nutritional quality. We deployed leaf packs containing senesced bluejoint grass (Calamagrostis canadensis) across a natural nutrient gradient of 6 salmon-rearing headwater streams on the lower Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. We hypothesized that litter-colonizing microbes would use dissolved stream nutrients and enhance breakdown rates, litter nutrient concentrations, and densities of macroinvertebrates across streams. Leaf-pack mass and nutrient concentrations were measured on the material at 0 (predeployment), 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk in all streams. Breakdown rates were calculated from the mass measurements with an exponential decay model. Macroinvertebrate composition and abundance were measured at 8 wk in all streams and every 2 wk in 1 stream. Breakdown rates of bluejoint litter were relatively low (20-30% mass loss over 2 mo), but similar to rates found in previous studies of senesced grass litter. Weighted regressions showed that bluejoint breakdown rates in the 6 streams were significantly (p < 0.05) related to dissolved stream nutrient concentrations (r(2) = 0.94 and 0.67 for dissolved inorganic N and PO4-P, respectively), litter nutrient concentration (r(2) = 0.72 and 0.96 for leaf % N and % P. respectively), total macroinvertebrates/g (r(2) = 0.73), and nonmetric multidimensional scaling-axis-1 scores of macroinvertebrate community structure (r(2) = 0.80). Litter nutrients changed after just 2 wk and were increasingly and significantly related to stream nutrient concentrations over time. NMS ordination showed that succession of macroinvertebrates on leaf packs from one stream followed a distinct direction over time, and a large shift in macroinvertebrate community structure occurred between weeks 6 and 8, a result potentially indicating a consumer response to microbial conditioning. The abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrate taxa using bluejoint litter provide evidence that it is an important habitat and energy pathway for consumers in headwater streams of the Kenai Peninsula. In addition, climate change has the potential to change terrestrial vegetation assemblages, which drive differences in stream nutrient concentrations in this region. If N-fixing shrubs become more abundant in the future, litter-decomposition rates will be positively affected by increases in both stream and leaf-litter nutrient concentrations.",,,,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,0887-3593,,,,,JUN,2011,30,2,,,,,386,398,,10.1899/10-086.1,,,,,,,WOS:000290361600005,,,,,09/09/2020,336,empirical,freshwater litter decomposition,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In this study, we used the process model ecosys to test hypotheses for these changes with CO2 and energy fluxes measured by eddy covariance over a mesic shrub tundra at Daring Lake, Canada, under varying growing seasons. These tests corroborated substantial rises in NPP, smaller rises in Rh, and, hence, rises in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) from 17 to 45 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (net C sink), modeled with higher T-a and longer growing seasons. However, NEP was found to decline briefly during midsummer warming events (T-a > 20 degrees C). A model run under climate change predicted for Daring Lake indicated that rises in NPP would exceed those in Rh during the first 100 years, causing NEP to rise. Rises in NPP were driven by more rapid net N mineralization from more rapid Rh in warming soils. However, greater declines in NEP were modeled during more frequent and intense midsummer warming events as climate change progressed. Consequently, average annual NEP (+/- interannual variability) rose from 30 (+/- 13) g C m(-2) yr(-1) under current climate to 57 (+/- 40) g C m(-2) yr(-1) after 90 years but declined to 44 (+/- 51) g C m-2 yr(-1) after 150 years, indicating that gains in tundra NEP under climate change may not be indefinite.",,,,,"Grant, Robert/0000-0002-8890-6231; Humphreys, Elyn/0000-0002-5397-2802",,,,,,,,,,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,MAR 18,2011,116,,,,,,,,G01031,10.1029/2010JG001555,,,,,,,WOS:000288607000002,,,,,09/09/2020,337,modelling,carbon and energy fluxes,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We present 15 new C. tetragona chronologies from three sites (Axel Heiberg, Bathurst, and Devon islands) in the eastern Canadian Arctic, of which three are the first continuous stable carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13) time series developed for Arctic shrubs. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses revealed that multiple and different climate factors influenced the chronologies within and between the three sites. At the Axel Heiberg Island site, the dominant climatic influences over annual stem elongation were previous year (t-1) and current year (t) summer precipitation, while annual production of flower buds was influenced by (t) winter precipitation and spring temperature. At Bathurst Island, annual production of flower buds responded to (t-l) growing season sunshine hours and winter precipitation and to (t) late growing season temperature and moisture availability. Our analysis of the Axel Heiberg and Bathurst Island models revealed the positive influence on delta C-13 values of (t-1) winter temperature and on Bathurst Island only, of (t-1) spring sunshine hours. The combined influence of these parameters on spring moisture availability suggests that the delta C-13 ratios varied in response to stomatal conductance. At Devon Island, the delta C-13 values varied in response to (t) and (t-1) spring and summer temperature and spring and fall solar radiation, which in turn influence the rate of photosynthesis. Our study supports the emerging hypothesis that Arctic shrubs are sensitive to climate. However, strong spatial variation in plant-climate response characterized our sampling sites.

Location: Northern boreal forest, interior Alaska. Methods: We compared plant community composition and environmental stand characteristics in 14 black spruce stands before and after multiple, naturally occurring wildfires. We used a combination of vegetation table sorting, univariate (ANOVA, paired t-tests), and multivariate (detrended correspondence analysis) statistics to determine the impact of fire severity and site moisture on community composition, dominant species and growth forms. Results: Severe wildfires caused a 50% reduction in number of plant species in our study sites. The largest species loss, and therefore the greatest change in species composition, occurred in severely burned sites. This was due mostly to loss of non-vascular species (mosses and lichens) and evergreen shrubs. New species recruited most abundantly to severely burned sites, contributing to high species turnover on these sites. As well as the strong effect of fire severity, pre-fire and post-fire mineral soil pH had an effect on post-fire vegetation patterns, suggesting a legacy effect of site acidity. In contrast, pre-fire site moisture, which was a strong determinant of pre-fire community composition, showed no relationship with post-fire community composition. Site moisture was altered by fire, due to changes in permafrost, and therefore post-fire site moisture overrode pre-fire site moisture as a strong correlate. Conclusions: In the rapidly warming climate of interior Alaska, changes in fire severity had more effect on post-fire community composition than did environmental factors (moisture and pH) that govern landscape patterns of unburned vegetation. This suggests that climate change effects on future community composition of black spruce forests may be mediated more strongly by fire severity than by current landscape patterns. Hence, models that represent the effects of climate change on boreal forests could improve their accuracy by including dynamic responses to fire disturbance.",,,,,"Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910",,,,,,,,,,,,1100-9233,1654-1103,,,,FEB,2011,22,1,,,,,32,44,,10.1111/j.1654-1103.2010.01231.x,,,,,,,WOS:000286146800004,,,,,09/09/2020,340,empirical,forest community structure,abundance,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

A transition towards more shrub-dominated tundra may have large implications for the regional surface energy balance, permafrost stability and carbon storage capacity, with consequences for the global climate system. However, little information is available on the natural long-term shrub growth response to climatic variability. Our aim was to determine the climate factor and time period that are most important to annual shrub growth in our research site in NE-Siberia. Therefore, we determined annual radial growth rates in Salix pulchra and Betula nana shrubs by measuring ring widths. We constructed shrub ring width chronologies and compared growth rates to regional climate and remotely sensed greenness data. Early summer temperature was the most important factor influencing ring width of S. pulchra (Pearson's r = 0.73, p < 0.001) and B. nana (Pearson's r = 0.46, p < 0.001). No effect of winter precipitation on shrub growth was observed. In contrast, summer precipitation of the previous year correlated positively with B. nana ring width (Pearson's r = 0.42, p < 0.01), suggesting that wet summers facilitate shrub growth in the following growing season. S. pulchra ring width correlated positively with peak summer NDVI, despite the small coverage of S. pulchra shrubs (<5% surface cover) in our research area. We provide the first climate-growth study on shrubs for Northeast Siberia, the largest tundra region in the world. We show that two deciduous shrub species with markedly different growth forms have a similar growth response to changes in climate.

Yet, little is known about the functional significance of this colour change, or why it occurs in some species but not others. Here, the biochemistry, physiology and ecology associated with winter leaf reddening are reviewed, with special focus on its possible adaptive function. Photoprotection is currently the favoured hypothesis for winter reddening, but alternative explanations have scarcely been explored. Intraspecific reddening generally increases with sunlight incidence, and may also accompany photosynthetic inferiority in photosynthetically 'weak' (e.g. low-nitrogen) individuals. Red leaves tend to show symptoms of shade acclimation relative to green, consistent with a photoprotective function. However, winter-red and winter-green species often cohabitate the same high-light environments, and exhibit similar photosynthetic capacities. The factors dictating interspecific winter leaf colouration therefore remain unclear. Additional outstanding questions and future directions are also highlighted, and possible alternative functions of winter reddening discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-646X,1469-8137,,,,,2011,190,3,,,,,573,581,,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03662.x,,,,,,,WOS:000289641600010,21375534,,,,09/09/2020,342,review,evergreen leaf development,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Recent evidence of this trend is an outbreak of Cytospora canker disease (fungal pathogen Valsa melanodiscus (anamorph = Cytospora umbrina)) on Alnus species. For Alnus fruticosa, we examined the effects of water stress on disease predisposition, and the effects of disease and water stress on host physiology. In two trials, we conducted a full-factorial experiment that crossed two levels of water stress with three types of inoculum (two isolates of V. melanodiscus, one control isolate). Water stress was not required for disease predisposition. However, the effects of water stress and disease on host physiology were greatest near the peak phenological stage of the host and during hot, dry conditions. During this time, water stress and disease reduced light-saturated photosynthesis (-30%), light saturation point (-60%) and stomatal conductance (-40%). Our results depended on the timing of water stress and disease in relation to host phenology and the environment.

In 2007, we conducted a reciprocal translocation experiment on 100 x 100 x 40 cm coherent turf and soil along an elevation gradient of 3200-3800 m on the south slope of Qilian Mountains northeast of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The aim was to understand the warming/cooling effects on the alpine ecosystem where treatments were simulated by donor elevations below/above receptors. Translocated vegetation comprised the Kobresia meadow at 3200 m, deciduous shrub meadow at 3400 m, forbs meadow at 3600 m, and sparse vegetation at 3800 m. The 5 x 5 cm grid method (50 x 50 cm, 100 grids) was used for surveying plant species absolute abundance in translocated quadrats. Results showed that species richness and Shannon-Weaver index of Kobresia meadow increased significantly (P <0.05) when translocated to 3400 m. Shannon-Weaver index of shrub meadow declined, while shrub species abundance responded slightly both to warming and cooling treatments. Both species richness and Shannon-Weaver index of forbs meadow and sparse vegetation were enhanced evidently at 3200 m and 3400 m. Four groups were identified by non-metric multidimensional scaling based on receptor elevation. Responses of the alpine plant community and the function group appeared to be specific to climate magnitude and specific to function type, respectively. Correlation indicated that climatic factors played a much more important role than soil in the response of the alpine plant community. Four vegetation types were sensitive to climate change, while Kobresia meadow behaved flexibly.

John",,,Long-term ecosystem dynamics of a small lake and its catchment in west Greenland,HOLOCENE,,,,,,,,,,,,"We investigated the interplay between climate and the Holocene ecological development of a small low-Arctic lake and its catchment. The remains of terrestrial and aquatic oribatid mites, plant macrofossils, and other invertebrates in a sediment core from Lake SS16 in west Greenland revealed its palaeoecological history over the last 6950 years. Betula nana immigrated into Dryas fell-field and open grassland around 6600 cal.yr BP and then expanded to dominate dwarf-shrub heath that clothed the catchment for 4800 years. Like other lakes in Greenland, the mesotrophic SS16 became progressively oligotrophic as a consequence of nutrient depletion and reduced runoff from the maturing catchment vegetation. Abrupt declines of Lepidurus arcticus and Daphnia probably reflect the immigration of fish around 6300 cal. yr BP. After c. 2000 cal. yr BP, catchment heathland declined with Neoglacial cooling and reduced precipitation and was replaced by open Dryas grassland vegetation and bare soil. Lake productivity also decreased. The major early-Holocene catchment changes pre-date the aquatic changes, revealing decoupling of ecological responses to climate. In the late Holocene, however, climate change was the predominant driver in both lake and catchment. This multiproxy study shows the valuable contribution made by oribatid mites in the reconstruction of direct processes (e. g. precipitation: evaporation ratio), indirect processes (e. g. nutrient sequestration by maturing tundra vegetation, immigration of taxa), and internal feedbacks (e. g. trophic interactions) that controlled ecosystem development in the past.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0959-6836,1477-0911,,,,DEC,2010,20,8,,,,,1207,1222,,10.1177/0959683610371995,,,,,,,WOS:000284467600003,,,,,09/09/2020,345,empirical,historical lake development,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Therefore, there is a need for reliable climate proxies to increase knowledge of past and future Arctic climate change. Annual shoot length increase of the circumarctic dwarf shrub species Cassiope tetragona represents such a new climate proxy. We measured annual shoot length increase of 32 plant samples of the circumarctic dwarf shrub species C tetragona using the presence of wintermarksepta within the stems, resulting in a 169 year growth chronology (1840-2008) for a High Arctic site on Svalbard. This is the longest growth chronology for dwarf shrub species produced up to now. Relationships between climate and Cassiope growth were investigated through correlative, response function and forward stepwise multiple regression analysis. July average air temperature was found to be the most important factor determining growth, by itself capable of explaining 41% of the variance in shoot growth between 1912 and 2008. The second best predictors were previous year September precipitation sums and average air temperatures, along with several previous growth parameters. A multiple regression model explaining growth with current July and previous year September temperature, combined with previous growth of lag 1, 2 and 5 years as predictors explains 70% of the observed variance in growth. July temperatures and previous year September precipitation sums alone explain 59% of the variance in standardized growth. Mean July air temperature was reconstructed for the period between 1876 and 2007 by a growth-temperature transfer model, using current and following year's growth. The estimated temperatures correlated well with measured temperatures over the calibration (1912-1959) and verification (1960-2007) period: R-2 = 0.34 and R-2 = 0.47, respectively. The instrumental record (1912-2008) extended with these reliable mean July temperature estimates (1876-1911) reveals a significant warming trend on Svalbard since 1876 of 0.07 degrees C decade(-1) on average. This study shows that the climate-growth relationships in C tetragona, its longevity, its annual resolution, the availability of (sub)fossil fragments in tundra soil cores and its circumartic distribution make it a very valuable tool for climate reconstructions beyond the instrumental record and in areas lacking meteorological data, throughout the Arctic.

Over-expression of MdFT1 in Arabidopsis and the commercially important tree species poplar and apple itself using the CaMV 35S or the Arabidopsis Suc2 promoter resulted in significant accelerated flowering compared with wild-type plants. Transgenic T-0 plants of Arabidopsis flowered 4-6 days on average earlier than wild-type Arabidopsis under LD conditions. Under short-day conditions Suc2::MdFT1 plants of the T-1-generation flowered after 66 +/- A 18 days, while wild-type plants flowered about 22 days later. All transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed a normal habit except for the early flowering phenotype. Early flowering was detected 6-10 months after transformation in transgenic polar clones containing MdFT1 driven by the CaMV 35S, whereas plants of the transgenic apple clone T780 set up its first flowers during in vitro cultivation.

However, both the protection mechanisms may be lost with winter climate change, especially during extreme winter warming events where loss of snow cover from snow melt results in exposure of plants to warm temperatures and then returning extreme cold in the absence of insulating snow. These events cause considerable damage to Arctic plants, but physiological responses behind such damage remain unknown. Here, we report simulations of extreme winter warming events using infrared heating lamps and soil warming cables in a sub-Arctic heathland. During these events, we measured maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII), photosynthesis, respiration, bud swelling and associated bud carbohydrate changes and lipid peroxidation to identify physiological responses during and after the winter warming events in three dwarf shrub species: Empetrum hermaphroditum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Vaccinium myrtillus. Winter warming increased maximum quantum yield of PSII, and photosynthesis was initiated for E. hermaphroditum and V. vitis-idaea. Bud swelling, bud carbohydrate decreases and lipid peroxidation were largest for E. hermaphroditum, whereas V. myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea showed no or less strong responses. Increased physiological activity and bud swelling suggest that sub-Arctic plants can initiate spring-like development in response to a short winter warming event. Lipid peroxidation suggests that plants experience increased winter stress. The observed differences between species in physiological responses are broadly consistent with interspecific differences in damage seen in previous studies, with E. hermaphroditum and V. myrtillus tending to be most sensitive. This suggests that initiation of spring-like development may be a major driver in the damage caused by winter warming events that are predicted to become more frequent in some regions of the Arctic and that may ultimately drive plant community shifts.",,,,"Bokhorst, Stef/D-1858-2009; Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014","Bjerke, Jarle/0000-0003-2721-1492; Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107",,,,,,,,,,,,0031-9317,1399-3054,,,,OCT 10,2010,140,2,,,,,128,140,,10.1111/j.1399-3054.2010.01386.x,,,,,,,WOS:000281716700003,20497369,,,,09/09/2020,349,empirical,plant physiology,physiology,"Abisko, SE",68.35,18.817,physiology,winter extreme events,abiotic,Empetrum nigrum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Vaccinium myrtillus,3,species,,WOS search

Here we present data from three lake sediment cores and show a much more detailed history from geochemical and isotope data. These data show that the Faroe Islands were deglaciated by the end of Younger Dryas (11,700 10,300 cal yr BP), at this time relatively high sedimentation rates with high delta C-13 imply poor soil development. delta C-13, Ti and chi data reveal a much more stable and warm mid-Holocene until 7410 cal yr BP characterised by increasing vegetation cover and build up of organic soils towards the Holocene thermal maximum around 7400 cal yr BP. The final meltdown of the Laurentide ice sheet around 7000 cal yr BP appears to have impacted both ocean and atmospheric circulation towards colder conditions on the Faroe Islands. This is inferred by enhanced weathering and increased deposition of surplus sulphur (sea spray) and erosion in the highland lakes from about 7400 cal yr BP. From 4190 cal yr BP further cooling is believed to have occurred as a consequence for increased soil erosion due to freeze/thaw sequences related to oceanic and atmospheric variability. This cooling trend appears to have advanced further from 3000 cal yr BR A short period around 1800 cal yr BP appears as a short warm and wet phase in between a general cooling characterised by significant soil erosion lasting until 725 cal yr BP. Interestingly, increased soil erosion seems to have begun at 1360 cal yr BP, thus significantly before the arrival of the first settlers on the Faroe Island around 1150 cal yr BP, although additional erosion took place around 1200 cal yr BP possibly as a consequence of human activities. Hence it appears that if humans caused a change in the Faroe landscape in terms of erosion they in fact accelerated a process that had already started. Soil erosion was a dominant landscape factor during the Little Ice Age, but climate related triggers can hardly be distinguished from human activities. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Two approaches for estimating climate parameters from pollen data were tested independently, WA-PLS (weighted-averaging regression and calibration partial least squares) and MAT (The Modern Analogues Technique) methods. The results of cross-validation showed that pollen data could effectively estimate annual average precipitation (P-ann) (WA-PLS: R-jack(2) = 0.84, RMSEPjack = 78 mm; MAT: R = 0.91, Std. dev. = 79 mm); but were only moderately successful at estimating either mean annual temperature (WA-PLS: R-jack(2) = 0.48, RMSEjack = 2.5 degrees C; MAT: R = 0.68, Std. dev.= 2.5 degrees C) or the mean temperature of the warmest month (WA-PLS: R-jack(2) = 0.50, RMSEPjack2 = 2.6 degrees C; MAT: R = 0.72, Std. dev.= 2.6 C). One of the reasons for errors in estimating thermal parameters is the presence of some 'troublesome' samples in the dataset, samples from communities with severe human disturbance or from small patches of vegetation close to an ecotone. Removing 104 samples affected by these factors gave a 'BEST' pollen dataset, which was able to estimate thermal parameters with a greater degree of accuracy (R>0.8 or R-jack(2)>0.64). All these methods were applied to a published paleo-record, the Anyang-Chadianpo section, covering the period about 10,000 cal. B.P.-present. MAT and WA-PLS methods reconstructed similar P-ann records, but thermal parameters showed more severe and abrupt changes when reconstructed using the MAT approach rather than the WA-PLS method. Using the different pollen data sets (all 494, or 390 BEST samples) for each method led to similar paleoclimate reconstructions in most periods, apart from periods of climate transition (e.g. 6200-6800 cal. B.P., 3000-4000 cal. B.P.) or intensive human activity (after 1000 cal. B.P.), suggesting that the influence of human activities and small patches on the composition of the pollen record are more significant in these periods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Climate change is altering snowfall regimes, which in turn influences snow cover and ultimately tundra plant communities. The interest in winter climate change and the number of experiments exploring the responses of alpine and Arctic ecosystems to changes in snow cover have been growing in recent years, but their outcomes are difficult to summarize because of the large variability in manipulation approaches, extents and measured response variables. In this review, we (1) compile the ecological publications on snow manipulation experiments, (2) classify the studies according to the climate scenarios they simulate and response variables they measure, (3) discuss the methods applied to manipulate snow cover, and (4) analyse and generalize the response in phenology, productivity and community composition by means of a meta-analysis. This meta-analysis shows that flowering phenology responded strongly to changes in the timing of snowmelt. The least responsive group of species were graminoids; however, they did show a decrease in productivity and abundance with experimentally increased snow covers. The species group with the greatest phenological response to snowmelt changes were the dwarf shrubs.

Over the last few decades, snowmelt in many arctic and alpine regions has advanced, causing the growing season to start earlier and last longer. In a field experiment in subarctic tundra in Interior Alaska, I manipulated the timing of snowmelt and measured the response in mortality, phenology, growth, and reproduction of the eight dominant plant species. I then tested whether the phenological development of these species was controlled by snowmelt date or by temperature (in particular growing degree days, GDD). In order to expand our understanding of plant sensitivity to snowmelt timing, I explored whether the response patterns can be generalized with regard to the temporal niche of each species. Differences in the phenology between treatments were only found for the first stages of the phenological development (=phenophases). The earlier the temporal niche (i.e., the sooner after snowmelt a species develops) the more its phenology was sensitive to snowmelt. Later phenophases were mostly controlled by GDD, especially in late-developing species. In no species did an earlier snowmelt and a longer growing season directly enhance plant fitness or fecundity, in spite of the changes in the timing of plant development. In conclusion, the temporal niche of a species' phenological development could be a predictor of its response to snowmelt timing. However, only the first phenophases were susceptible to changes in snowmelt, and no short-term effects on plant fitness were found.",,,,"Wipf, Sonja/A-5075-2010","Wipf, Sonja/0000-0002-3492-1399",,,,,,,,,,,,1385-0237,1573-5052,,,,MAR,2010,207,1,,,,,53,66,,10.1007/s11258-009-9653-9,,,,,,,WOS:000274211800005,,,,,09/09/2020,354,empirical,shrub performance,growth; phenology; reproduction,"Alaska, US",64.95,-148.367,experimental manipulation,temperature; snow cover,abiotic,Rhododendron tomentosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Empetrum nigrum; Cassiope tetragona; Betula nana; Vaccinium uliginosum,6,species,,WOS search

In Delta junction, Alaska plant communities in CRP fields are transitioning from grasslands to shrub dominated plant communities. which are resulting in compliance problems with program regulations that state fields must be maintained in a condition that permits easy conversion to cropland. To determine plant succession and how previous land management and soils might influence the transition, we measured plant populations in 20 CRP fields throughout Delta junction using modified-Whittaker plots. These data were combined with data on current Management practices, previous farming history, soils, soil properties, diversity indices, and time since land was cleared and analyzed with nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination to determine factors that influence plant succession. Time in the CRP was the only factor consistently influencing plant succession. As time in the CRP increased, the planted introduced grasses brome grass (Bromus inermis) and red fescue (Festuca rubra) and the native pteridophyte (Equisetum arvense) decreased, whereas a native grass (Calamigrostis canadensis), five native forb, two native shrub, and three native tree species increased. Plant diversity increased at a rate of more than 2 species per 1000 m(2) per year. Regression analyses of plant species and plant groups using time in the CRP as the dependent variable resulted in the identification of outlier CRP fields with significantly more or less than expected covers of vegetation. All fields with these outliers had reasonable explanations for the differences in cover that were unrelated to the overall rate of plant succession. Current management practices will result in incompliant fields and different management practices that result in woody vegetation control is key to maintaining CRP fields in compliance.

The snow was about twice as deep in the valley as on the plateau at the end of each winter and melted out about 10 days later. The site with buried vegetation showed a transition from air-to-surface heat transfers to surface-to-air heat transfers as bare ground became exposed during snowmelt, but there were daytime transfers of heat from the surface to the air at the site with exposed vegetation even while snow remained on the ground. A model calculating separate energy balances for snow and exposed vegetation, driven with meteorological data from the sites, is found to be able to reproduce these behaviours. Averaged over 30-day periods the model gives about 8 Wm(-2) more sensible heat flux to the atmosphere for the valley site than for the plateau site.

Just after snowmelt in early July, the ecosystem released CO2 into the atmosphere. A few days after snowmelt, however, the ecosystem became a CO2 sink as the leaves of S. polaris developed. Diurnal changes in NEP mirrored changes in light incidence (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) in summer.

During this time, CO2 was sometimes released into the atmosphere. In wet conditions, moss made a larger contribution to NEP. In fact, the water content of the moss regulated NEP during autumn.

Since the vegetation builds an isolation layer, which protects the permafrost from heat and cold temperatures, a degradation of this layer due to fire strongly influences the frozen conditions in the soil. Fire is an important disturbance factor which affects vast processes and dynamics in ecosystems (e.g. biomass, biodiversity, hydrology, etc.).

However, herbivory plays an important role in structuring these ecosystems and their responses to warming. Aims: To experimentally test how grazing and increased growing season temperature influence growth, physiognomy and stature of birch in the alpine zone. Methods: Trait responses of naturally regenerated birch saplings to warming (open-top chambers), and changed grazing regime (exclosures) were compared with those growing in unmanipulated conditions over a 10-year period (1999-2008). The effect of treatment over time and differences between treatments were analysed with repeated measures GLM (Generalised Linear Model) and simple contrasts in GLM. Results: Warming alone had no major effect on trait responses, however, significantly smaller leaves and an increased number of short shoots indicated warming-related growth constraints. Grazing showed a strong controlling effect on most traits, conserving low stature sapling stage characterised by fewer shoots and larger leaves, compared with non-grazed treatments. Conclusions: Although derived from one experimental site, the results point to a grazing-controlled response to environmental change, with climate (warming) as a secondary driver.

As it is adapted to underlying permafrost, its marginal sites at its southern distribution limit could be excellent indicators of climate change. There are still some scattered outpost stands of tussock tundra in the subarctic-alpine area of northern Fennoscandia, now showing signs of decline. Aims: The objective was to document changes in community structure of the tussock tundra over a 12-year period in experimentally warmed plots and in non-manipulated controls. In addition, the study included a survey of the present cover of tussock tundra in northern Swedish Lapland and a long-term monitoring of annual flowering intensity in the dominant species, the arctic hare's-tail cottongrass, Eriophorum vaginatum. Methods: The extent of tussock tundra in the region was assessed in a helicopter survey in 2005, followed by ground truthing in 2006. Climate and permafrost have been monitored at Latnjajaure, northern Swedish Lapland, since 1992. An experimental warming study employing open-top chambers (OTCs) was initiated at Latnjajaure for a number of habitats in 1993-1995, and all tussock tundra plots were surveyed in 1995 and 2006. Non-manipulated, permanently marked E. vaginatum tussocks were monitored for flowering frequency annually in 1992-2008. Results: The helicopter survey indicated that tussock tundra covers only few km(2) in northernmost Sweden. A stand at the lower end of its altitude range was already in an advanced stage of transition into shrub tundra. In the OTCs at Latnjajaure, evergreen boreal dwarf-shrubs (particularly Vaccinium vitis-idaea) increased in above-ground biomass about eightfold between 1995 and 2006, and almost fourfold in the controls. There has been a significant warming trend in the study area of 0.12 degrees C per year, likely explaining why the control plots have also changed. The annual monitoring of E. vaginatum flowering indicated a tendency for relaxed synchrony of masting episodes in recent years, probably caused by longer growing seasons.

I sampled willow thickets at different slope positions at 13 sites along a 300-km-long north-south transect. The measurements included the height of willow shrubs and the length and diameter of shoots. The length and diameter of willow shoots increased southwards and with increasing distance from the sea. At the top of the slope and in areas with shallow thaw, the height and growth of willow were low compared to other slope positions and to areas with deep thaw. An increasing level of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) grazing intensity was associated with decreased height and growth of willow and also associated with reduced foraging activity of willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus). The results show that even though increasing summer warmth is likely to enhance willow growth, there are other factors such as distance from the sea that also affect the growth and height of willow.

However, herbivores can also influence the abundance of shrubs in arctic ecosystems. We addressed these alternative explanations by following the changes in plant community composition during the last 10 years in permanent plots inside and outside exclosures with different mesh sizes that exclude either only reindeer or all mammalian herbivores including voles and lemmings. The exclosures were replicated at three forest and tundra sites at four different locations along a climatic gradient ( oceanic to continental) in northern Fennoscandia. Since the last 10 years have been exceptionally warm, we could study how warming has influenced the vegetation in different grazing treatments. Our results show that the abundance of the dominant shrub, Betula nana, has increased during the last decade, but that the increase was more pronounced when herbivores were excluded. Reindeer have the largest effect on shrubs in tundra, while voles and lemmings have a larger effect in the forest. The positive relationship between annual mean temperature and shrub growth in the absence of herbivores and the lack of relationships in grazed controls is another indication that shrub abundance is controlled by an interaction between herbivores and climate. In addition to their effects on taller shrubs (>0.3 m), reindeer reduced the abundance of lichens, whereas microtine rodents reduced the abundance of dwarf shrubs (<0.3 m) and mosses. In contrast to short-term responses, competitive interactions between dwarf shrubs and lichens were evident in the long term.

Association of phenological patterns with growth form will therefore help elucidate the role of phenology in an ecosystem. We ask whether growth forms of common vascular plants differ in terms of vegetative and flowering phenology, and if such phenological differences are consistent across environmental gradients caused by landscape-scale topography. Location: A high-latitude alpine landscape in Finnmark County, Norway (70 degrees N). Methods: We assessed vegetative and flowering phenology repeatedly in five growth forms represented by 11 common vascular plant species across an altitudinal gradient and among differing slope aspects. Results: Species phenology Clustered well according to growth form, and growth form strongly explained variation in both flowering and vegetative phenology. Altitude and aspect were poor predictors of phenological variation. Vegetative phenology of the growth forms, ranked from slowest to fastest, was in the order evergreen shrubs <sedges-deciduous shrubs <grasses <forbs, while a reverse ranking was found for flowering phenology. Conclusion: Growth form-specific phenological patterns are associated with fundamentally different abilities for resource acquisition and resource conservation. The weak effect of landscape-scale topographic factors indicates that variation within growth forms is mainly influenced by local environmental factors not accounted for in this study. On the basis of these results, we argue that growth forms should be considered as predictors of phenology together with the customary use of topography and normalized difference vegetation index, especially when assessing the role of phenology in an ecosystem.",,,,"Brathen, Kari Anne/AAN-4666-2020; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Brathen, Kari Anne/0000-0003-0942-1074",,,,,,,,,,,,1100-9233,1654-1103,,,,OCT,2009,20,5,,,,,903,915,,10.1111/j.1654-1103.2009.01088.x,,,,,,,WOS:000270031300011,,,,,09/09/2020,366,empirical,phenology,phenology,"Finnmark, NO",69.883,24.917,monitoring,growth form; slope,biotic; abiotic,Empetrum nigrum; Betula nana; Vaccinium myrtillus,3,species,,WOS search

We aim to investigate mechanisms through which herbivory by geese influences vegetation and soil processes in tundra ecosystems under ambient and warmed conditions. To achieve this, two grazing treatments, clipping plus faecal additions and moss removal, were implemented in conjunction with passive warming. Our key finding was that, in many cases, the tundra ecosystem response was determined by treatment impacts on the moss layer. Moss removal reduced the remaining moss layer depth by 30% and increased peak grass biomass by 27%. These impacts were probably due to observed higher soil temperatures and decomposition rates associated with moss removal. The positive impact of moss removal on grass biomass was even greater with warming, further supporting this conclusion. In contrast, moss removal reduced dwarf shrub biomass possibly resulting from increased exposure to desiccating winds. An intact moss layer buffered the soil to increased air temperature and as a result there was no response of vascular plant productivity to warming over the course of this study. In fact, moss removal impacts on soil temperature were nearly double those of warming, suggesting that the moss layer is a key component in controlling soil conditions. The moss layer also absorbed nutrients from faeces, promoting moss growth. We conclude that both herbivory and warming influence this high arctic ecosystem but that herbivory is the stronger driver of the two. Disturbance to the moss layer resulted in a shift towards a more grass-dominated system with less abundant mosses and shrubs, a trend that was further enhanced by warming. Thus herbivore impacts to the moss layer are key to understanding arctic ecosystem response to grazing and warming.",,,,"van der Wal, Rene/F-3177-2010","Jonsdottir, Ingibjorg Svala/0000-0003-3804-7077",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,OCT,2009,161,4,,,,,747,758,,10.1007/s00442-009-1427-5,,,,,,,WOS:000269860700010,19701775,,,,09/09/2020,367,empirical,vegetation changes,biomass,"Svalbard, NO",78.167,16.117,factorial experiment,herbivory; temperature,biotic; abiotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

A high degree of variability is thus generally observed in radionuclide transfers and redistribution patterns in contaminated forests. In the long term, the soil compartment represents the major reservoir of radionuclides which can give rise to long-term plant and hence food contamination. For practical reasons, the contamination of various specific forest products has commonly been quantified using the aggregated transfer factor (T-ag in m(2)kg(-1)) which integrates various environmental parameters including soil and plant type, root distribution as well as nature and vertical distribution of the deposits. Long lasting availability of some radionuclides was shown to be the source of much higher transfer in forest ecosystems than in agricultural lands. This study aimed at reviewing the most relevant quantitative information on radionuclide transfers to forest biota including trees, understorey vegetation, mushrooms, berries and game animals. For both radiocaesium and radiostrontium in trees, the order of magnitude of mean T-ag values was 10(-3) m(2) kg(-1) (dry weight). Tree foliage was usually 2-12 times more contaminated than trunk wood. Maximum contamination of tree components with radiocaesium was associated with (semi-)hydromorphic areas with thick humus layers. The transfer of radionuclides to mushrooms and berries is high, in comparison with foodstuffs grown in agricultural systems. Concerning caesium uptake by mushrooms, the transfer is characterized by a very large variability of T-ag, from 10(-3) to 10(1) m(2)kg(-1) (dry weight). For berries, typical values are around 0.01-0.1 m(2) kg(-1) (dry weight). Transfer of radioactive caesium to game animals and reindeer and the rate of activity reduction, quantified as an ecological half-life, reflect the soil and pasture conditions at individual locations. Forests in temperate and boreal regions differ with respect to soil type and vegetation, and a faster decline of muscle activity concentrations in deer occurs in the temperate zone. However, in wild boar the caesium activity concentration shows no decline because of its special feeding habits. In the late phase, i.e. at least a few months since the external radionuclide contamination on feed plants has been removed, a T-ag value of 0.01 m(2) kg(-1) (fresh weight) is common for (CS)-C-137 in the muscles of adult moose and terrestrial birds living in boreal forests, and 0.03 m(2) kg(-1) (fresh weight) for arctic hare. Radiocaesiurn concentrations in reindeer muscle in winter may exceed the summer content by a factor of more than two, the mean T-ag values for winter ranging from 0.02 to 0.8 m(2) kg(-1) (fresh weight), and in summer from 0.04 to 0.4 m(2) kg(-1) The highest values are found in the year of initial contamination, followed by a gradual reduction. In waterfowl a relatively fast decline in uptake of Cs-137 has been found, with T-ag values changing from 0.01 to 0. 002 m(2) kg(-1) (fresh weight) in the three years after the contaminating event, the rate being determined by the dynamis of (CS)-C-137 in aquatic ecosystems.

We investigated the relationships between plant functional type composition, soil organic matter quality and decomposer community composition, and how these are related to major environmental variation in non-acid and acid soils derived from calcareous versus siliceous bedrocks, respectively. We analysed vegetation, organic matter and microbial community compositions from five non-acidic and five acidic heath sites in alpine tundra in northern Europe. Sequential organic matter fractionation was used to characterize organic matter quality and phospholipid fatty acid analysis to detect major variation in decomposer communities. Non-acidic and acidic heaths differed substantially in vegetation composition, and these disparities were associated with congruent shifts in soil organic matter and microbial communities. A high proportion of forbs in the vegetation was positively associated with low C:N and high soluble N:phenolics ratios in soil organic matter, and a high proportion of bacteria in the microbial community. On the contrary, dwarf shrub-rich vegetation was associated with high C:N and low soluble N:phenolics ratios, and a high proportion of fungi in the microbial community. Our study demonstrates a strong link between the plant community composition, soil organic matter quality, and microbial community composition, and that differences in one compartment are paralleled by changes in others. Variation in the forb-shrub gradient of vegetation may largely dictate variations in the chemical quality of organic matter and decomposer communities in tundra ecosystems.

Spatial variation in snowshoe hare ( Lepus americanus) density reflects the fire mosaic. Because fire initiates secondary forest succession, a fire mosaic creates variation in the abundance of early successional plants that snowshoe hares eat in winter, leading to geographic variation in hare density. We hypothesize that fire is the template for a geographic mosaic of natural selection: where fire is greatest and hares are most abundant, hare browsing has most strongly selected juvenile-phase woody plants for defense. We tested the hypothesis at multiple spatial scales using Alaska birch (Betula neoalaskana) and white birch (Betula papyrifera). We also examined five alternative hypotheses for geographic variation in antibrowsing defense. The fire-hare-defense hypothesis was supported at transcontinental, regional, and local scales; alternative hypotheses were rejected. Our results link transcontinental variation in species interactions to an abiotic environmental driver, fire.

Disturbance associated with warming permafrost can change microclimate and expose areas of ion-rich mineral substrate for colonization by plants. Consequently, the response of vegetation to warming air temperatures may differ significantly from disturbed to undisturbed tundra. Across a latitudinal air temperature gradient, we tested the hypothesis that the microenvironment in thaw slumps would be warmer and more nutrient rich than undisturbed tundra, resulting in altered plant community composition and increased green alder (Alnus viridis subsp. fruticosa) growth and reproduction. Our results show increased nutrient availability, soil pH, snow pack, ground temperatures, and active layer thickness in disturbed terrain and suggest that these variables are important drivers of plant community structure. We also found increased productivity, catkin production, and seed viability of green alder at disturbed sites. Altered community composition and enhancement of alder growth and reproduction show that disturbances exert a strong influence on deciduous shrubs that make slumps potential seed sources for undisturbed tundra. Overall, these results indicate that accelerated disturbance regimes have the potential to magnify the effects of warming temperature on vegetation.

Air temperatures decreased (1985 through 1999) while permafrost warmed and thawed creating thermokarst terrain, probably as a result of increased snow depths. Permafrost, active layer and ground-ice conditions at the Healy site are the result of the interaction of climatic, ecologic and other factors. The slow accumulation of ground ice in an intermediate permafrost layer formed by upward freezing from the permafrost surface leads to long-term differential frost heave and microrelief. When ground ice in the permafrost melts, the ground Surface settles differentially resulting in thermokarst terrain (pits, gullies). Windblown snow fills the thermokarst depressions causing further warming and thawing of the underlying permafrost a positive feedback effect that enhances permafrost degradation. Thermokarst-induced changes in relief alter the near-surface hydrology and ecological processes. Changes in vegetation included differential tussock growth and mortality and a shift in moss species abundance and relative productivity, depending on microtopographic position created by the thermokarst terrain. Water redistribution towards thermokarst depressions caused adjacent higher areas to become drier and resulted in increased moss mortality and shrub abundance.

However, the mechanisms and factors controlling processes such as soil carbon turnover can be difficult to quantify due to methodological or logistical constraints. Soil incubation experiments have the potential to greatly improve our understanding of belowground carbon dynamics, but relating results from laboratory-based incubations to processes measured in the field is challenging. This study has two goals: (1) development of a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model for analyzing soil incubation data and complementary field data to gain a more mechanistic understanding of soil carbon turnover; (2) application of the approach to soil incubation data collected from a semi-arid riparian grassland experiencing encroachment by nitrogen-fixing shrubs (mesquite). Soil was collected from several depths beneath large-sized shrubs, medium-sized shrubs, grass, and bare ground-the four primary microsite-types found in this ecosystem. We measured respiration rates from substrate-induced incubations, which were accompanied by measurements of soil microbial biomass, soil carbon, and soil nitrogen. Soils under large shrubs had higher respiration rates and support 2.0, 1.9, and 2.6 times greater soil carbon, microbial biomass, and microbial carbon-use efficiency, respectively, compared to soils in grass microsites. The effect of large shrubs on these components is most pronounced near the soil surface where microbial carbon-use efficiency is high because of enhanced litter quality. Grass microsites were very similar to bare ground in many aspects (carbon content, microbial biomass, etc.). Encroachment of mesquite shrubs into this semi-arid grassland may enhance carbon and nutrient cycling and increase the spatial heterogeneity of soil resource pools and fluxes. The HB approach allowed us to synthesize diverse data sources to identify the potential mechanisms of soil carbon and microbial change associated with shrub encroachment.",,,,,"Pavao-Zuckerman, Mitchell/0000-0002-9657-2892",,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,1573-5036,,,,JUL,2009,320,1-2,,,,,153,167,,10.1007/s11104-008-9880-1,,,,,,,WOS:000266828500009,,,,,09/09/2020,373,empirical,soil carbon dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Across vegetation types. leaf biomass, leaf N, and moss N pool size influenced GEP. Within most vegetation types GEP correlated with leaf N, in correspondence with the notion that N may limit plant production in many high arctic ecosystems.

By advancing the timing when plants started their growing season and thus lost their winter frost hardiness, earlier snowmelt also changed the number of low-temperature events they experienced while frost sensitive. This seemed to outweigh the positive effects of a longer growing season and hence, aboveground growth was reduced after advanced snowmelt in three of the four species studied. Only Loiseleuria procumbens, a specialist of wind exposed sites with little snow, benefited from an advanced snowmelt.

In this paper, we review how key ecosystem processes will be altered by these transformations, the complex biological cascades and feedbacks that might result, and some of the potential broader consequences for the earth system. Firstly, we consider how patterns of growth and allocation, and nutrient uptake, will be altered by the shifts in plant dominance. The ways in which these changes may disproportionately affect the consumer communities, and rates of decomposition, are then discussed. We show that the occurrence of a broad spectrum of plant growth forms in these regions (from cryptogams to deciduous and evergreen dwarf shrubs, graminoids and forbs), together with hypothesized low functional redundancy, will mean that shifts in plant dominance result in a complex series of biotic cascades, couplings and feedbacks which are supplemental to the direct responses of ecosystem components to the primary global change drivers. The nature of these complex interactions is highlighted using the example of the climate-driven increase in shrub cover in low-Arctic tundra, and the contrasting transformations in plant functional composition in mid-latitude alpine systems. Finally, the potential effects of the transformations on ecosystem properties and processes that link with the earth system are reviewed. We conclude that the effects of global change on these ecosystems, and potential climate-change feedbacks, cannot be predicted from simple empirical relationships between processes and driving variables.

Beaver selectively forage willow to provide fresh food, stored winter food, and construction material. The effects of this complex foraging behavior on the structure and function of willow communities is poorly understood. Simulation modeling may help ecologists understand these complex interactions. In this study, a modified version of the SAVANNA ecosystem model was developed to better understand how beaver foraging affects the structure and function of a willow community in a simulated riparian ecosystem in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado (RMNP). The model represents willow in terms of plant and stem dynamics and beaver foraging in terms of the quantity and quality of stems cut to meet the energetic and life history requirements of beaver. Given a site where all stems were equally available, the model suggested a simulated beaver family of 2 adults, 2 yearlings, and 2 kits required a minimum of 4 ha of willow (containing about 10 stems m(-2)) to persist in a steady-state condition. Beaver created a willow community where the annual net primary productivity (ANPP) was 2 times higher and plant architecture was more diverse than the willow community without beaver. Beaver foraging created a plant architecture dominated by medium size willow plants, which likely explains how beaver can increase ANPP. Long-term simulations suggested that woody biomass stabilized at similar values even though availability differed greatly at initial condition. Simulations also suggested that willow ANPP increased across a range of beaver densities until beaver became food limited. Thus, selective foraging by beaver increased productivity, decreased biomass, and increased structural heterogeneity in a simulated willow community.

We found 201 macrolichen taxa. Two primary gradients in lichen species composition were related to substrate pH and vegetation physiognomy, grading from forests to high alpine communities. Site characteristics associated with the first community gradient are soil moisture and exposure. Both ends of this gradient, including protected forests and densely shrubby sites at one end and exposed, high elevation alpine sites at the other end, are relatively dry and well-drained. The mid-region of this gradient consists of mesic, lowland tundra habitats. The second gradient, related to substrate pH, is driven by the presence of Sphagnum moss contrasting with calcareous soils and bedrock. Combining these two gradients of lichen community composition, we found six groups of plots using two-way cluster analysis. Further, division of macrolichen species occurring in five or more plots yielded seven species groups, based on a combination of environmental factors and species distribution characteristics.

Since most woody plants have evolved freezing tolerance (FT) in winter, together with similar lignified structures and winter adaptive mechanisms, it is more likely to find cold resistant genes in woody plants growing in temperate and arctic regions. In this study, Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, an evergreen, broadleaf and leguminous shrub was selected as a model to study cold tolerance in woody plants. Thirteen cold up-regulated cDNAs (including eight full-length cDNAs and five partial cDNAs) were cloned from A. mongolicus. One of these genes, AmEBP1, confers enhanced cold tolerance to E. coli and obvious increased freezing survival to Arabidopsis. In transgenic Arabidopsis expressing AmEBP1, transcript levels of some downstream genes in cold signaling exhibit increased accumulation upon cold treatment. Together with structural information, sub-cellular location, and promoter analysis data, it is suggested that AmEBP1 enhances plants cold tolerance by accelerating ribosome biogenesis and the concomitant translation of cold induced transcription factors and downstream protective proteins under cold stress.",,,,"Cao, Pengxiu/I-5378-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-4412,1573-5028,,,,MAR,2009,69,5,,,,,529,539,,10.1007/s11103-008-9434-1,,,,,,,WOS:000263506400003,19067182,,,,09/09/2020,380,empirical,woody plant genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Here, we combine multi-scale sub-pixel analysis and remote sensing time-series analysis to investigate recent decadal changes in vegetation greenness along spatial gradients of summer temperature and vegetation. Linear autoregression temporal analysis of vegetation greenness was performed with relatively pure vegetation pixels of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, spanning Low Arctic, High Arctic and polar desert ecosystems. Vegetation greenness generally increased over tundra ecosystems in the past two decades. Peak annual greenness increased 0.49-0.79%/yr over the High Arctic where prostrate dwarf shrubs, forbs, mosses and lichens dominate and 0.46-0.67%/yr over the Low Arctic where erect dwarf shrubs and graminoids dominate. However, magnitudes of vegetation greenness differ with length of time series and periods considered, indicating a nonlinear response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change.

The C-14 content of DOC is relatively modern throughout the peat column, to depths of 3 m. In sedge-dominated peatlands, the C-14 contents of the products of respiration, CH4 and DIC, are essentially the same and are similar to that of DOC. In Sphagnum- and woody plant-dominated peatlands with few sedges, however, the respiration products are similar but intermediate between the C-14 contents of the solid phase peat and the DOC. Preliminary data indicates qualitative differences in the pore water DOC, depending on the extent of sedge cover, consistent with the hypothesis that the DOC in sedge-dominated peatlands is more reactive than DOC in peatlands where Sphagnum or other vascular plants dominate. These data are supported by molecular level analysis of DOC by ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry that suggests more dramatic changes with depth in the composition of DOC in the sedge-dominated peatland pore waters relative to changes observed in DOC where Sphagnum dominates. The higher reactivity of DOC from sedge-dominated peatlands may be a function of either different source materials or environmental factors that are related to the abundance of sedges in peatlands.",,,,"Burdige, David/AAI-1073-2019","Burdige, David/0000-0002-8859-7096",,,,,,,,,,,,0886-6236,1944-9224,,,,DEC 27,2008,22,4,,,,,,,GB4022,10.1029/2008GB003274,,,,,,,WOS:000262041000002,,,,,09/09/2020,383,empirical,boreal peatland gas exchange,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In 1997, a 3.4-km stream channel, designed to divert water around an open pit diamond mine, was excavated in the Barrenlands region of the Canadian Arctic to create productive stream habitat. We evaluated the initial success of this compensation program by comparing multiple biological attributes of the constructed stream during its first three years to those of natural reference streams in the area. The riparian zone of the constructed stream was largely devoid of vegetation throughout the period, in contrast to the densely vegetated zones of reference streams. The constructed stream also contained lower amounts of woody debris, coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM), and epilithon; had lower coverage by macrophytes and bryophytes; and processed leaf litter at a lower rate than reference streams. Species richness and densities of macroinvertebrates were consistently lower in the constructed stream compared to natural streams. This contributed to differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure throughout the period, although assemblages showed some convergence by year 3. The effectiveness of the constructed stream to emulate natural streams varied somewhat depending on the biological attribute being evaluated. Assessments based on individual attributes showed that minimal to moderate levels of similarity between the constructed stream and natural streams were achieved. A collective assessment of all biological and ecosystem attributes suggested that the constructed stream was not a good surrogate for natural streams during these first years. Additional time would be required before many characteristics of the constructed stream would resemble those of reference streams. Because initial efforts to improve fish habitat in the constructed stream focused on physical structures (e.g., weirs, vanes, rock, groins), ecological factors limiting fish growth were not considered and likely constrained success. We suggest that a greater focus on organic characteristics and vegetation within the stream and its riparian zone could have accelerated compensation. The addition of woody debris and CPOM, combined with planting of shrubs and herbs along the stream, should provide a source of allochthonous matter for the biotic community while large cobble and boulders should improve the physical stability of stream system, protecting its organic components.",,,,"Tonn, William/A-3765-2014","Tonn, William/0000-0002-0509-3184",,,,,,,,,,,,0364-152X,1432-1009,,,,DEC,2008,42,6,,,,,1064,1076,,10.1007/s00267-008-9218-z,,,,,,,WOS:000260952100014,18839240,,,,09/09/2020,384,empirical,stream ecology,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

The vegetation of the Last Interglacial period evolved from a prostrate dwarf-shrub tundra to a low- and high-shrub tundra vegetation. The succession of four Arctic biomes was distinguished from the Last Interglacial sediments, whereas only one Arctic biome was recorded in the Holocene sediments. From ca. 8300 cal. years BP to present, hemiprostrate dwarf-shrub tundra occupied the soils around Fog Lake. During the Last Interglacial, growing season sunshine was higher than during the Holocene and July air temperature was 4 to 5 degrees C warmer than present. A principal component analysis helped in assessing relationship between floristic gradients and climate. The major vegetation changes through the Last Interglacial and Holocene were driven by July air temperature variations, whereas the minor, or subtle, vegetation changes seem rather correlated to September sunshine.

We studied cryogenic structures and morphological properties of soils associated with patterned-ground features along a bioclimate gradient in Arctic Alaska and Canada from north (subzone A) to south (subzone E). Most of these soils have strongly developed cryogenic features, including warped and broken horizons, and organic matter moved into the upper permafrost. The expression of cryoturbation generally increases with the gradient southward. Soil color reflects the lithology of the soil, weathering, and accumulation of organic matter. The organic horizons form around the circles, and gleyed matrix with redoximorphic features develop in the lower active layers due to saturation above the permafrost. Cryostructure development depends more on hydrology controlled by microtopography than position along the gradient. The cryostructures form due to freeze-thaw cycles and ice lens formation, which include granular, platy, lenticular, reticulate, suspended (ataxitic), ice lens, and ice wedges. On the surface, the density of nonsorted circles reached their maximum in subzones C and D. However, once the vegetation cover was removed, the nonsorted pattern grounds reached their optimum stage and become closed packed in subzone E.

Three decades after disturbance, drilling sumps had developed vegetation coverage equivalent to that in undisturbed areas, although bare soil persisted in ponded areas and where a salt crust was present. Vegetation on sumps was composed of communities dominated by forbs, grasses, and tall shrubs that were distinct from adjacent, undisturbed sedge and low shrub communities. The area of altered vegetation around a sump was generally larger in upland or saline environments than in lowland areas. Pooled water observed around many sumps was likely associated with thaw subsidence that occurred following construction, which was subsequently compounded by snow drifting and increased soil temperatures along the margins of the sump mound.

In this study, we sampled and analyzed the aboveground plant biomass components of patterned-ground ecosystems in the Arctic of northern Alaska and Canada along an 1800-km north-south gradient that spans approximately 11 degrees C of mean July temperatures. Vegetation biomass was analyzed as functions of the summer warmth index (SWI - sum of mean monthly temperatures > 0 degrees C). The total absolute biomass (g m(-2)) and biomass of shrubs increased monotonically with SWI, however, biomass of nonvascular species ( mosses and lichens), were a parabolic function of SWI, with greatest values at the ends of the gradient. The components of plant biomass on patterned-ground features (i.e., on nonsorted circles or within small polygons) were constrained to a greater degree with colder climate than undisturbed tundra, likely due to the effect of frost heave disturbances on the vegetation. There were also clear differences in the relative abundances of vascular versus nonvascular plants on and off patterned-ground features along the SWI gradient.

In the function building, the key point is the response sensitivity to the climate change for different pollen families and categories. As an example in this paper, the pollen samples from the surface and stratum in Dajiuhu basin, Shennongjia are used to estimate the sensitivity of pollen factor-temperature in the transfer function by the EOF analysis, multiple regression and stepwise regression techniques. Thereafter, the selection methods of pollen factors are discussed and compared with other results from different researchers. The results show that in the pollen samples, the quantity of woody plants is larger than others, but the woody plants have relatively lower sensitivity and slow responses to the climate evolution and abrupt climate change. While the pollens from lower grade plants (herb and fern) have a relatively high sensitivity to the temperature change and fast response to the abrupt climate changes. Therefore, the pollen of herb and fern may significantly record the extreme events in the climate change. Also in different regions, the pollen samples have different sensitivity and optimum combination in the transfer functions. Final conclusion is that the stepwise regression is one of the best methods for transfer function building since it can obtain the maximum multiple correlation coefficients and optimum combination of sensitive pollen factors.",,,,"Zhu, Cheng/E-4698-2013","Zhu, Cheng/0000-0002-0593-1395",,,,,,,,,,,,1001-6538,1861-9541,,,,MAR,2008,53,,,1,,,50,57,,10.1007/s11434-008-5002-y,,,,,,,WOS:000256309000005,,,,,09/09/2020,390,empirical,pollen composition,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We incorporate additional plant functional types, i.e. shrubs and defined different types of open ground vegetation, to improve the representation of arctic vegetation in the global model. We use future climate projections as well as control climate data for 1981-2000 from a regional climate model (REMO) that assumes a development of atmospheric CO2-concentration according to the B2-SRES scenario [IPCC, Climate Change 2001: The scientific basis. Contribution working group I to the Third assessment report of the IPCC. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (2001)]. The model showed a generally good fit with observed data, both qualitatively when model outputs were compared to vegetation maps and quantitatively when compared with observations of biomass, NPP and LAI. The main discrepancy between the model output and observed vegetation is the overestimation of forest abundance for the northern parts of the Kola Peninsula that cannot be explained by climatic factors alone. Over the next hundred years, the model predicted an increase in boreal needle leaved evergreen forest, as extensions northwards and upwards in mountain areas, and as an increase in biomass, NPP and LAI. The model also projected that shade-intolerant broadleaved summergreen trees will be found further north and higher up in the mountain areas. Surprisingly, shrublands will decrease in extent as they are replaced by forest at their southern margins and restricted to areas high up in the mountains and to areas in northern Russia. Open ground vegetation will largely disappear in the Scandinavian mountains. Also counter-intuitively, tundra will increase in abundance due to the occupation of previously unvegetated areas in the northern part of the Barents Region. Spring greening will occur earlier and LAI will increase. Consequently, albedo will decrease both in summer and winter time, particularly in the Scandinavian mountains (by up to 18%). Although this positive feedback to climate could be offset to some extent by increased CO2 drawdown from vegetation, increasing soil respiration results in NEE close to zero, so we cannot conclude to what extent or whether the Barents Region will become a source or a sink of CO2.",,,,"Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013; Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014; Wolf, Annett/A-1207-2012","Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0165-0009,1573-1480,,,,MAR,2008,87,1-2,,,,,51,73,,10.1007/s10584-007-9342-4,,,,,,,WOS:000253347000004,,,,,09/09/2020,391,modelling,vegetation changes,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In boreal black spruce (Picea mariana) forests near Delta Junction, Alaska, we quantified aboveground plant biomass and net primary productivity (ANPP) for 4 years after a 1999 wildfire in a well-drained (dry) site, and also across a dry and a moderately well-drained (mesic) chronosequence of sites that varied in time since fire (2 to similar to 116 years). Four years after fire, total biomass at the 1999 burn site had increased exponentially to 160 +/- 21 g m(-2) (mean +/- 1SE) and vascular ANPP had recovered to 138 +/- 32 g m(-2) y(-1), which was not different than that of a nearby unburned stand (160 +/- 48 g m(-2) y(-1)) that had similar pre-fire stand structure and understory composition. Production in the young site was dominated by re-sprouting graminoids, whereas production in the unburned site was dominated by black spruce. On the dry and mesic chronosequences, total biomass pools, including overstory and understory vascular and non-vascular plants, and lichens, increased logarithmically (dry) or linearly (mesic) with increasing site age, reaching a maximum of 2469 +/- 180 (dry) and 4008 +/- 233 g m(-2) (mesic) in mature stands. Biomass differences were primarily due to higher tree density in the mesic sites because mass per tree was similar between sites. ANPP of vascular and non-vascular plants increased linearly over time in the mesic chronosequence to 335 +/- 68 g m(-2) y(-1) in the mature site, but in the dry chronosequence it peaked at 410 +/- 43 g m(-2) y(-1) in a 15-year-old stand dominated by deciduous trees and shrubs. Key factors regulating biomass accumulation and production in these ecosystems appear to be the abundance and composition of re-sprouting species early in succession, the abundance of deciduous trees and shrubs in intermediate aged stands, and the density of black spruce across all stand ages.

Paired burned and unburned permanent vegetative cover transects were established after 1981, 1977, and 1972 tundra fires in northwestern Alaska to document regrowth of tundra vegetation including caribou forage lichens in the wintering range of Alaska's largest caribou herd. Following fire, lichen had recovered very little compared to unburned transects (1% cover vs. 15% cover) after 14 years. After 24 or 25 years, lichen cover in the burns remained low (3-4%), whether or not caribou were present during the recovery period. In addition, lichen cover on unburned transects at one study site had decreased from 14% to 6%. Shrub cover was higher on the burned plots than the unburned plots. Cover of cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) initially increased following the fire and tussocks quickly became more vigorous than on paired unburned transects, remaining so for more than 14 years. Persistent changes in vegetation following fire likely reflect the cumulative impacts of seasonal caribou use and favorable growing conditions (warmer soils, longer growing season) for rooted vascular species during the recovery period. The actual recovery of forage lichens after fire on our study sites is slower than predictions based on ideal growth potential.",,,,"Jandt, Randi/E-9018-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,1523-0430,,,,,FEB,2008,40,1,,,,,89,95,,10.1657/1523-0430(06-122)[JANDT]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,WOS:000252869000010,,,,,09/09/2020,393,empirical,post-fire lichen recovery,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Along with air and soil warming, one of the consequences of warming likely to be important for carbon assimilation of tundra plant species is an expected 40% increase in growing season length. We examined the effects of a lengthened growing season and soil warming on the photosynthetic capacity of seven tundra plant species from four growth forms that comprise >90% of the vascular cover of wet tussock tundra. Maximum photosynthetic capacity of these key species was relatively unchanged by the manipulation that significantly altered growing season length, active layer depth, and soil temperatures. Highest photosynthetic rates were found for the forb, Polygonum bistorta, and the lowest for dwarf evergreen shrubs. Seasonal patterns revealed that plants maintained relatively high light-saturated photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) values throughout most of the growing season. Interannual variation was significant, but differences were small for most species. The study shows that tundra species operate within a relatively narrow range for maximum photosynthetic capacity with this maximum seldom being reached under ambient conditions. Thus, when evaluating the effects of climate change on tundra ecosystem carbon uptake, species composition and total photosynthetic leaf area should be considered first. These two factors will affect the system carbon exchange capacity during climate warming more so than species-level assimilation capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1523-0430,1938-4246,,,,FEB,2008,40,1,,,,,181,191,,10.1657/1523-0430(06-015)[STARR]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,WOS:000252869000020,,,,,09/09/2020,394,empirical,photosynthetic activity,photosynthetic activity,"Alaska, US",68.633,-149.567,factorial experiment,temperature; growing season length,abiotic,Rhododendron tomentosum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Betula nana; Salix pulchra,4,species,,WOS search

Plant macrofossils from permafrost deposits on Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island, New Siberian Archipelago, in the Russian Arctic revealed the existence of a shrubland dominated by Duschekia fruticosa, Betula nana and Ledum palustre and interspersed with lakes and grasslands during the last interglacial. The reconstructed vegetation differs fundamentally from the high arctic tundra that exists in this region today, but resembles an open variant of subarctic shrub tundra as occurring near the tree line about 350 km southwest of the study site. Such difference in the plant cover implies that, during the last interglacial, the mean summer temperature was considerably higher, the growing season was longer, and soils outside the range of thermokarst depressions were drier than today. Our pollen-based climatic reconstruction suggests a mean temperature of the warmest month (MTWA) range of 9-14.5 degrees C during the warmest interval of the last interglacial. The reconstruction from plant macrofossils, representing more local environments, reached MTWA values above 12.5 degrees C in contrast to today's 2.8 degrees C. We explain this contrast in summer temperature and soil moisture with a combination of summer insolation higher than present and climatic continentality in arctic Yakutia stronger than present as result of a considerably less inundated Laptev Shelf during the last interglacial.

The studies were carried out in the high-arctic valley of Zackenbergdalen in Northeast Greenland. Vegetation type dynamics and land surface phenology were studied through the use of hand-held sensors of reflection of vegetation, from which the far red normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI-FR) can be inferred. Furthermore, species-specific dynamics were studied through measures of timing and magnitude of flowering through a period of 10 years. Time of snowmelt and temperature were the major controlling factors for the timing of the phenology in the six vegetation types: fell-field, Dryas heath, Cassiope heath, Salix heath, grassland, and fen. Snowmelt had a linear positive effect on the timing of the maximum of the growing season, with late snowmelt, causing a later occurrence of the maximum. While higher summed temperatures during the green-up period (time from snowmelt to maximum) also was shown to be positively related to the timing of the maximum, enhanced flower production seemed to cause lower vegetative biomass production and hence a later maximum. The seasonal vegetative production, expressed as the seasonal integrated NDVI-FR (SINDVI), had a linear negative relation with the temperatures during the previous summer. This was probably due to higher temperatures causing more flowers the following year, leading to a lower NDVI-FR. A strong negative trend in maximum NDVI-FR is documented in all six vegetation types during the years from 1999 to 2006 with a decrease of 0.01 NDVI-FR per year. The main reason could be drying of the upper soil layers due to earlier snowmelt and higher evapotranspiration during recent years. Some general trends in phenological characteristics were recognised, although responses varied among species. The time of snow disappearance was the main determinant for onset of flowering. Shrubs seemed to be superior in taking advantage of an early snowmelt with respect to initiation of flowering. In addition, most species developed flowers and seed capsules faster when temperatures increased. More flowers increase the chance of cross-pollination and hence, offer an increased possibility for sexual reproduction and genetic exchange. Most species increased the number of flowers in years following a warm growing season in the previous year, although some species also depended on climatic conditions in the current year prior to onset of flowering. Experimental manipulations of growing season length, temperature and incoming radiation in plots with the dominant dwarf shrub, white arctic bell-heather Cassiope tetragona, confirmed that this species significantly reduced flowering when subjected to shading or reduced growing season length. Based on current predictions for climatic changes in the Zackenberg area (Stendel et al., 2008, this volume), it is expected that the plant species currently present will be able to put more effort in sexual reproduction, thus ensuring increased species adaptedness to changing climate through enhanced genetic variance. However, this is provided that seeds are able to germinate, that species are not out-competed by faster growing and canopy-forming invading species, and that species are able to continue flowering even under reduced light levels caused by an increased cloud-cover.",,,,"Hansen, Birger/E-5192-2015; Tamstorf, Mikkel/AAB-6627-2020; Michelsen, Anders/L-5279-2014; Tamstorf, Mikkel/I-7101-2013","Hansen, Birger/0000-0002-5440-6925; Tamstorf, Mikkel/0000-0002-2811-331X; Michelsen, Anders/0000-0002-9541-8658; Tamstorf, Mikkel/0000-0002-2811-331X",,,,,,,,,,,,0065-2504,,978-0-12-373665-9,,,,2008,40,,,,,,249,273,,10.1016/S0065-2504(07)00011-6,,,,,,,WOS:000256528000011,,,,,09/09/2020,396,empirical,phenology,phenology; productivity,"Zackenberg, GL",74,21,factorial experiment; monitoring,vegetation type; temperature,biotic; abiotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

Unfortunately, large-scale, high-spatial-resolution observations of plant assemblages associated with these regions are generally unavailable, so accurate modeling of plant assemblages and biome boundaries is often needed. We built different discriminant analysis models and used them to convert various combinations of spatial climatic data (surface temperature and precipitation) and spatial environmental data (topography, soil, permafrost) into a biome-level map of Alaska. Five biomes (alpine tundra and ice fields, Arctic tundra, shrublands, boreal forest, and coastal rainforest) and one biome transition zone are modeled. Mean annual values of climatic variables were less useful than their annual extrema in this context. A quadratic discriminant analysis, combined with climate, topography, permafrost, and soil information, produced the most accurate Alaskan biome classification (skill = 74% when compared to independent data). The multivariate alteration detection transformation was used to identify Climatic Transition Zones (CTZs) with large interannual variability, and hence, less climatic consistency than other parts of Alaska. Biome classification was the least accurate in the CTZs, leading to the conclusion that large interannual climatic variability does not favor a unique biome. We interpret the CTZs as transition biome areas or ecotones between the five core biomes cited above. Both disturbance events (e.g., fires and subsequent plant succession sequences) and the partial intersection of the environmental variables used to characterize Alaskan biomes further complicate biome classification. Alaskan results obtained from the data-driven quadratic discriminant model compare favorably (based on Kappa statistics) with those produced by an equilibrium-based biome model for regions of Canada ecologically similar to the biomes we studied in Alaska.

They are highly hydrophilic, soluble upon boiling, and rich in glycine and polar amino acids. It is proposed that they can act as emulsifiers or chaperones in the cells, i.e., they protect proteins and membranes against unfavourable structural changes caused by dehydration. Cold usually precedes freezing in nature and induces many physiological and biochemical changes in the cells of freezing-tolerant plant species (cold-acclimation) that enable them to survive unfavourable conditions. It is demonstrated that the induction of dehydrin expression and their accumulation is an important part of this process in many dicotyledons (both herbaceous and woody species), and also in winter cultivars of cereals, especially wheat and barley. Some mechanisms which are proposed to be involved in regulation of dehydrin expression are discussed, i.e., endogenous content of abscisic acid, homologues of Arabidopsis C-repeat binding factor (CBF) transcriptional activators, the activity of vernalization genes and photoperiodic signals. Finally, we outline some new approaches emerging for the solution of the complex mechanisms involved in plant cold-acclimation, especially the methods of functional genomics that enable to observe simultaneously changes in the activity of many genes and proteins in a single sample.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3134,1573-8264,,,,DEC,2007,51,4,,,,,601,617,,10.1007/s10535-007-0133-6,,,,,,,WOS:000251185100001,,,,,09/09/2020,398,empirical,plant physiology,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Such phenological changes play a role in the structural changes within tundra ecosystem communities. Recently, we developed a model that estimates the leaf appearance date for deciduous trees in taiga. We apply this model to the whole low-arctic tundra, and we compare the simulated green-up dates with the green-up dates obtained from satellite observations and to in situ measurements of deciduous shrub leaf appearance. The model, although calibrated for taiga, performs remarkably well in tundra, with root mean square error ranging between 4 and 8 days for most of the tundra region, the same order as in taiga regions. The results seem to indicate that air temperature is the main factor controlling spring leaf phenology in tundra, just as in taiga, although these results do not permit us to reject soil temperature as the main trigger for leaf appearance in tundra. Because our model performs in tundra as well as in taiga, it can be used across the ecotone, and during a northward migration of the species from the taiga to the low-arctic region. The leaf appearance model and the satellite observations reveal that leaf appearance has tended to occur earlier by approximately 10 days both in Alaska since 1975, and in west Siberian tundra since 1965.",,,,"Picard, Ghislain/D-4246-2013","Picard, Ghislain/0000-0003-1475-5853; Delbart, Nicolas/0000-0002-0462-6305",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,DEC,2007,13,12,,,,,2551,2562,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01466.x,,,,,,,WOS:000251049000006,,,,,09/09/2020,399,modelling,phenology,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Drivers, such as climate change and increasing herbivore pressure, affect the moss layer thus, assessment of the functional role of mosses in determining soil characteristics is essential. Field manipulations conducted in high arctic Spitsbergen (78 degrees N), creating shallow (3 cm), intermediate (6 cm) and deep (12 cm) moss layers over the soil surface, had an immediate impact on soil temperature in terms of both average temperatures and amplitude of fluctuations. In soil under deep moss, temperature was substantially lower and organic layer thaw occurred 4 weeks later than in other treatment plots; the growing season for vascular plants was thereby reduced by 40%. Soil moisture was also reduced under deep moss, reflecting the influence of local heterogeneity in moss depth, over and above the landscape-scale topographic control of soil moisture. Data from field and laboratory experiments show that moss-mediated effects on the soil environment influenced microbial biomass and activity, resulting in warmer and wetter soil under thinner moss layers containing more plant-available nitrogen. In arctic ecosystems, which are limited by soil temperature, growing season length and nutrient availability, spatial and temporal variation in the depth of the moss layer has significant repercussions for ecosystem function. Evidence from our mesic tundra site shows that any disturbance causing reduction in the depth of the moss layer will alleviate temperature and moisture constraints and therefore profoundly influence a wide range of ecosystem processes, including nutrient cycling and energy transfer.",,,,"van der Wal, Rene/F-3177-2010","Jonsdottir, Ingibjorg Svala/0000-0003-3804-7077",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,OCT,2007,153,4,,,,,931,941,,10.1007/s00442-007-0785-0,,,,,,,WOS:000249407000014,17618466,,,,09/09/2020,400,empirical,soil environmental processes,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

This paper presents qualitative and quantitative comparisons between three such maps, and two more detailed vegetation maps compiled from fieldwork and from recent field-trained satellite image analysis, all for a study area in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russia. It is shown that, despite its high degree of generalisation, the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map provides the best representation of the vegetation in the study area amongst the three circumpolar land-cover maps that were examined, but that none of the three is entirely satisfactory. While the adequate representation of shrubs and lichens currently continues to depend on the analysis of field data or high-resolution satellite imagery which is unsuitable for circumpolar mapping, it is suggested that the prospects for satellite-based circumpolar vegetation mapping capable of including these components is promising.",,,,"Rees, William Gareth/AAM-9701-2020","Rees, William Gareth/0000-0001-6020-1232",,,,,,,,,,,,0032-2474,1475-3057,,,,OCT,2007,43,227,,,,,290,304,,10.1017/S0032247407006420,,,,,,,WOS:000250601400002,,,,,09/09/2020,401,empirical,reindeer grazing patterns,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Leaf litters collected from the predominant species in 33 global change manipulation experiments in circum-arctic-alpine ecosystems were incubated simultaneously in two contrasting arctic life zones. We demonstrate that longer-term, large-scale changes to leaf litter decomposition will be driven primarily by both direct warming effects and concomitant shifts in plant growth form composition, with a much smaller role for changes in litter quality within species.

After fire, near-surface soil showed increased moisture at the burned tussock site, remaining close to saturation throughout the thawed season 2003-2006. Despite wetter soil after the fire, freezing occurred earlier at the burned tussock site than at the control, indicating the importance of a reduced organic layer. Severe combustion of lichen and moss left 15-25 cm high tussocks, resulting in a doubling of the surface roughness coefficient. Average September temperature at the tussock site increased 2.3 +/- 0.7 degrees C throughout the 1 m soil profile, doubling the active layer depth, although this is due partly to favorable meteorological conditions.

Using field, Ikonos and Landsat data at three sites in northern Canada, we evaluate a physical unmixing method against two modeling approaches to map five land cover fractions that include bare, grass, deciduous shrub, conifer, and water along an 1100 km north-south transect crossing the tree-line of northern Canada. Error analyses are presented to assess factors that affect fractional mapping results, including modeling method (linear least squares inversion (LLSI) vs. linear regression vs. regression trees), number of Landsat spectral bands (3 vs. 5), local and distant fraction estimation using locally and globally calibrated models, and spatial resolution (30 m vs. 90 m). The ultimate purpose of this study is to determine if reliable land cover fractions can be obtained for biophysical modeling over northern Canada from a three band, resampled 90 m Landsat ETM+ mosaic north of the tree-line. Of the three modeling methods tested, linear regression and regression trees with five spectral bands produced the best local fraction estimates, while LLSI produced comparable results when unmixing was sufficiently determined. However, distant fraction estimation using both locally and globally calibrated models was most accurate using the three spectral bands available in the Landsat mosaic of northern Canada at 30 m resolution, and only slightly worse at 90 m resolution. While local calibrations produced more accurate fractions than global calibrations, application of local calibration models requires stratification of areas where local endmembers and models are representative.

The Tibetan fox Vulpes ferrilata Hodgson, 1842 is a characteristic species of the Tibetan Plateau. However, its habitat use is poorly known. We conducted a project (2001-2003) to better understand habitat use by the Tibetan fox in Shiqu County, Sichuan Province, China. The research site was classified into four land cover categories: grassland, grassland and shrubs, shrubs, and disturbed area (more than half of the area in a plot covered by bare soil and gravel). Their proportional share in land cover categories was estimated by line transects and used as expected land cover. Plots were also located at fox locations, fox dens, and fox feces (hereafter fox plots). Using Bonferroni z-statistics, land cover proportions in fox plots were compared with the expected land cover proportions. Tibetan foxes were found primarily in grassland habitat and there was evidence of use of grassland/shrub habitat and disturbed area. However, the fox were rarely observed in shrubs.

AMS radiocarbon dates and stratigraphic association of middens with Dawson tephra (similar to 25 300 C-14 yr BP), indicate these paleoecological data reflect the onset of glacial conditions of early Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 and terminal MIS 3 (similar to 24000-29 450 14C yr BP). Plant macrofossils include at least 60 plant taxa, including diverse graminoids (Poa, Elymus trachycaulus, Kobresia myosuroides), steppe forbs (Penstemon gormanii, Anemone patens var. multifida, Plantago cf. canescens), tundra forbs (Draba spp., Bistorta vivipara), dwarf shrubs (Salix cf. arctica, S. cf. polaris), sage (Artemisia frigida) and rare trees (Picea mariana). Many of these taxa identified in the middens represent the first recorded fossils for these plants in Eastern Beringia and add to our knowledge of the floristic composition of Pleistocene vegetation and biogeography in this region. Fossil beetles include typical members of the Eastern Beringian steppe-tundra fauna (Lepidophorus lineaticollis and Connatichela artemisiae) and others suggesting predominantly dry, open habitats. Cache forage selection is suggested by some plant taxa which were particularly frequent and abundant in the middens (Bistorta vivipara, Kobresia myosuroides, Ranunculus spp., Potentilla, Erysimum cf. cheiranthoides, Poa, Carex and Draba). Factors such as proximity of vegetation to burrows and abundance of fruits and seeds per plant were probably important in cache selection. Glacial conditions enabled arctic ground squirrels to form widespread and dense populations in regions such as the Klondike in which they are rare or absent at present. This fossil midden record supports previous hypotheses that suggest arctic ground squirrels evolved in and are well-adapted to the open, steppe-tundra vegetation, loessal soils and glacial climates of the mammoth-steppe biome.

Warming can affect vegetation communities directly through temperature effects on plant growth and indirectly through alteration of soil nutrient availability. In addition, warming can cause permafrost to thaw and thermokarst (ground subsidence) to develop, which can alter the structure of the ecosystem by altering hydrological patterns within a site. These multiple direct and indirect effects of permafrost thawing are difficult to simulate in experimental approaches that often manipulate only one or two factors. Here, we used a natural gradient approach with three sites to represent stages in the process of permafrost thawing and thermokarst. We found that vascular plant biomass shifted from graminoid-dominated tundra in the least disturbed site to shrub-dominated tundra at the oldest, most subsided site, whereas the intermediate site was co-dominated by both plant functional groups. Vascular plant productivity patterns followed the changes in biomass, whereas nonvascular moss productivity was especially important in the oldest, most subsided site. The coefficient of variation for soil moisture was higher in the oldest, most subsided site suggesting that in addition to more wet microsites, there were other microsites that were drier.

Thompson",,,Assessing impacts of large herbivores on shrubs: tests of scaling factors for utilization rates from shoot-level measurements,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Accurate methods for estimating the intensity of browsing by herbivores are fundamental to understanding the ecology of shrub communities. Quantifying browse utilization on shrubs at large scales is difficult because shrubs have complex, spatially variable growth forms. Most existing methods estimate browsing rate at the scale of linear current-year shoots or twigs. How such fine-scale estimates relate to the proportion of current-year growth consumed from whole plants or plots is often unknown. The relationship is likely to be complex because herbivores selectively browse more productive plants and plant parts. 2. Using a clipping experiment designed to mimic elk Cervus elaphus browsing, we quantified how utilization estimates at the scale of individual current-year shoots of two willow species, Salix bebbiana and Salix geyeriana, relate to actual mass removed at the scale of rooted stems. Three approaches to scaling were examined: (i) taking an average, (ii) multiplying by the proportion of shoots clipped and (iii) multiplying by a novel scaling factor that weights utilization by productivity. To address how to scale-up from stems to plots, we applied the most accurate stem-level method to elk-browsed willow and compared plot-level estimates by two scaling approaches. 3. In scaling from shoots to stems, the novel scaling factor was most successful and resulted in accurate estimates for up to c. 45% of current annual growth clipped. In scaling from the stem to the plot, elk preference for more productive stems caused a simple average of stem-level utilization to differ from a productivity-weighted average by 15%. 4. Synthesis and applications. In order to reflect accurately the proportion of biomass consumed at a whole-plant level, fine-scale estimates of utilization should be weighted by an estimate of pre-browse productivity, as this is mathematically equivalent to summing pre-browse and post-browse mass before calculating the proportion consumed. In developing methods to estimate utilization at plot scales, an important consideration is the choice of sampling unit, which should be both amenable to unbiased sampling and tractable in terms of measuring productivity.",,,,"Johnston, Danielle/D-1754-2013; Hobbs, Tom/C-5263-2016","Johnston, Danielle/0000-0002-6885-5369; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,FEB,2007,44,1,,,,,168,175,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01245.x,,,,,,,WOS:000243023600018,,,,,09/09/2020,408,methodological,herbivory assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Forest fires are the regions most dynamic disturbance factor, occurring mainly in Siberia, Russian Far East, Canada and Alaska, and these fires represent a globally important release of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere, via the burning of vegetation and organic soils. Currently the boreal region is believed to be a net carbon sink, but climate change predictions indicate significant boreal warming, with consequent increases in fire activity and carbon release. Ultimately, the boreal zone may become a net carbon source through forest fires and increased soil decomposition, and there is evidence that the Canadian forest may have already made this transition. Critical to estimating both direct and longer-term fire-related perturbations to boreal carbon storage is knowledge of fire extent, intensity and/or type, which has a strong control on forest fire damage, the fraction of available fuel combusted, and patterns of post-fire re-growth. These variables are currently derived from model-based assessment of often-uncertain accuracy, introducing large uncertainties to current carbon flux calculations. The post-fire re-growth process is of great importance since whilst tire releases carbon into the atmosphere, carbon sequestration through post-fire regeneration of plants and woody vegetation may help to reduce the amounts of carbon in the atmosphere. Observational data, such as vegetation indices, biophysical vegetation parameters, burnt area and fire radiative power, derived from satellite measurements are exploited to investigate post-fire regeneration and pre and post-fire temporal dynamics in the boreal forest. The relationship between post-fire dynamics and variables such as fire intensity, vegetation cover and climate are investigated. The ultimate aim of the proposed work is to improve insight into the Siberian boreal forest post-fire dynamics, leading to more realistic carbon flux quantification in the boreal biome and subsequently to a better quantitative understanding of the role of boreal forest regeneration in the global atmospheric carbon record.",,,,"Gerard, France/D-8428-2012; Balzter, Heiko/B-5976-2008","Gerard, France/0000-0001-5916-5174; Balzter, Heiko/0000-0002-9053-4684",,,,,,,,,,,,2153-6996,,978-1-4244-1211-2,,,,2007,,,,,,,4652,+,,,,,,,,,WOS:000256657304059,,,,,09/09/2020,410,review,post-fire succession,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Knowledge of the relationship between northern climate and vegetation productivity will also help provide a better understanding of changes in vegetation distributions as an indicator of climate change and variability. Vegetation productivity and biomass have been monitored using long-term satellite earth observations, mostly using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as a cumulative indicator of all effects resulting from processes related to climate change, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and disturbance. In this paper, the investigation is focused on the short-term effect of temperature anomalies on arctic and tree-line transition vegetation productivity in both dry and humid regions of Canada. The analysis shows that several land-cover types composed mainly of trees and shrubs exhibit a significant increase in NDVI with higher-than-normal temperatures in the preceding 10-40-day period, while land-cover types consisting of lichen and moss growing on mostly barren surfaces show a significant NDVI decrease with increased temperature. These trends are consistent with results reported in plot-warming experiments in the north, which have shown that certain vegetation communities increase, while others decrease in cover fraction and biomass in response to warming. When land cover is grouped into increasing and decreasing NDVI with temperature and stratified by dry and humid regions of Canada, much of the dry region of northern Canada does not exhibit significant NDVI response to preceding temperature anomalies. It is expected that in the absence of disturbance or other limiting factors, an increased frequency of elevated temperature anomalies may eventually contribute to changes in vegetation biomass. A map of land-cover types that have the potential to increase in biomass with climate warming and those that are vulnerable to decline is presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0143-1161,1366-5901,,,,,2007,28,21,,,,,4823,4840,,10.1080/01431160701268996,,,,,,,WOS:000250358700008,,,,,09/09/2020,411,empirical,temperature anomaly effects on vegetation,productivity,"Canada, CA",,,remote sensing,temperature,abiotic,,unknown,landscape,,WOS search

This study examines midsummer CO2 and H2O fluxes measured using the eddy covariance technique above seven northern peatlands including a low-shrub bog, two open poor fens, two wooded moderately rich fens, and two open extreme-rich fens. Gross ecosystem production and ecosystem respiration correlated positively with vegetation indices and with each other. Consequently, 24-hour net ecosystem CO2 exchange was similar among most of the sites (an average net carbon sink of 1.5 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)) despite large differences in water table depth, water chemistry, and plant communities. Evapotranspiration was primarily radiatively driven at all sites but a decline in surface conductance with increasing water vapor deficit indicated physiological restrictions to transpiration, particularly at the peatlands with woody vegetation and less at the peatlands with 100% Sphagnum cover. Despite these differences, midday evapotranspiration ranged only from 0.21 to 0.34 mm h(-1) owing to compensation among the factors controlling evapotranspiration. Water use efficiency varied among sites primarily as a result of differences in productivity and plant functional type.

Studies in many ecosystems have focussed on competition; however, facilitation has often been found to outweigh competition under harsh environmental conditions. The balance between positive and negative species interactions is known to shift along spatial, temporal and environmental gradients and thus is likely to be affected by climate change. Winter temperature and precipitation patterns in Interior Alaska are rapidly changing and could lead to warmer winters with a shallow, early melting snow cover in the near future. We conducted snow manipulation and neighbour removal experiments to test whether the relative importance of positive and negative species interactions differs between three winter climate scenarios in a subarctic tundra community. In plots with ambient, manually advanced or delayed snowmelt, we assessed the relative importance of neighbours for survival, phenology, growth and reproduction of two dwarf shrub species. Under ambient conditions and after delayed snowmelt, positive and negative neighbour effects were generally balanced, but when snowmelt was advanced we found overall facilitative neighbour effects on survival, phenology, growth and reproduction of Empetrum nigrum, the earlier developing of the two target species. As earlier snowmelt was correlated with colder spring temperatures and a higher number of frosts, we conclude that plants experienced harsher environmental conditions after early snowmelt and that neighbours could have played an important role in ameliorating the physical environment at the beginning of the growing season.",,,,"Wipf, Sonja/A-5075-2010","Wipf, Sonja/0000-0002-3492-1399; Rixen, Christian/0000-0002-2486-9988",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,AUG,2006,12,8,,,,,1496,1506,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01185.x,,,,,,,WOS:000239004700012,,,,,09/09/2020,414,empirical,shrub interactions,phenology; survival; growth; reproduction,"Alaska, US",64.95,-148.367,factorial experiment,snow cover; neighbour presence,biotic; abiotic,Empetrum nigrum; Vaccinium vitis-idaea,2,species,,WOS search

Plant species were assigned to functional (woody versus herbaceous) and biogeographic (boreal versus alpine) groups. Invertebrate species were classified as either herbivore or predator. When species interactions and effects of the abiotic environment were partitioned, boreal species appeared to influence the distribution of alpine species and woody species the distribution of herbaceous species. Analysis of partial correlations indicated that facilitation was the dominant mode of interaction between the two pairs of plant groups. Among abiotic factors, the thermal environment probably influenced all components of the plant and invertebrate communities, except for predatory invertebrates, and wind appeared important in determining the composition of woody and alpine components of the plant community but not the herbaceous component. The composition of the boreal component of the plant community apparently influenced the composition of all invertebrate communities, except for predatory invertebrates. The composition of the woody component of the plant community influenced the composition of both herbivore and predator communities. The alpine plant-community composition influenced predatory invertebrate community composition. Woody plant community composition influenced the composition of both herbivore and predator communities.

Open Poaceae and Artemisia associations dominated vegetation at the beginning of the interglacial period. Rare shrub thickets (Salix, Betula nana, Alnus fruticosa) grew in more protected and wetter places as well. Saalian ice wedges started to melt during this time, resulting in the formation of an initial thermokarst water body. The high percentage of semi-aquatic chironomids suggests that a peatland-pool initially existed at the site. A distinct decrease in semi-aquatic chironomid taxa and an increase in lacustrine ones point to a gradual pooling of water in the basin, which could in turn induce thermokarst and create a permanent pond during the subsequent period. The highest relative abundance of Chironomus and Procladius reflects unfrozen water remaining under the ice throughout the ice-covered period during the later stage of palaeo-lake development. The chironomid record points to three successive stages during the history of the lake: (1) a peatland pool; (2) a pond (i.e., shallower than the maximum ice-cover thickness); and (3) a shallow lake (i.e., deeper than the maximum ice-cover thickness). The trend of palaeo-lake development indicates that intensive thermokarst processes occurred in the region during the last Interglacial. Shrub tundra communities with Alnus fruticosa and Betula nana dominated the vegetation during the interglacial optimum. The climate was moister and warmer than present.

The main aims were to compare the seasonal course and treatment effects on CBSC among the species, life forms and leaf cohorts and to examine whether the responses in different CBSC were consistent across compounds. The changes in leaf chemistry both during the season and in response to the treatments were higher in S. herbacea x polaris than in the corresponding current year's leaf cohort of the evergreen C. tetragona. The changes were also much higher than in the 1-year-old leaves of the two evergreens probably due to differences in dilution and turnover of CBSC in growing and mature leaves paired with different rates of allocation. Most low molecular weight phenolics in the current year's leaves decreased in all treatments. Condensed tannins and the tannin-to-N ratio, however, either increased or decreased, and the strength and even direction of the responses varied among the species and leaf cohorts, supporting views of influential factors additional to resource-based or developmental controls, as e.g. species specific or genetic controls of CBSC. The results indicate that there is no common response to environmental changes across species and substances.

Image spatial analysis was used to examine the spatial pattern of greenness dynamics from 1991 to 2000 as indicated by variations of the maximum normalized difference vegetation index (Peak NDVI) and time-integrated NDVI (TI-NDVI) along latitudinal gradients. Spatial gradients for both the means and temporal variances of the NDVI indices for 0.1 degrees latitude intervals crossing three bioclimate subzones were analyzed along two north-south Arctic transects. NDVI indices were generally highly variable over the decade, with great heterogeneity across the transects. The greatest variance in TI-NDVI was found in low shrub vegetation to the south (68.7-68.8 degrees N) and corresponded to high fractional cover of shrub tundra and moist acidic tundra (MAT), while the greatest variance in Peak-NDVI predominately occurred in areas dominated by wet tundra (WT) and moist nonacidic tundra (MNT). Relatively high NDVI temporal variances were also related to specific transitional areas between dominant vegetation types. The regional temporal variances of NDVI from 1991 to 2000 were largely driven by meso-scale climate dynamics. The spatial heterogeneity of the NDVI variance was mostly explained by the fractional land cover composition, different responses of each vegetation type to climate change, and patterned ground features. Aboveground plant biomass exhibited similar spatial heterogeneity as TI-NDVI; however, spatial patterns are slightly different from NDVI because of their nonlinear relationship.",,,,"Jia, Gensuo/AAL-2681-2020","Jia, Gensuo/0000-0001-5950-9555",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JAN,2006,12,1,,,,,42,55,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.01079.x,,,,,,,WOS:000234527600004,,,,,09/09/2020,418,empirical,vegetation productivity,productivity,"Northern Alaska, US",71,-156.5,remote sensing,temperature,abiotic,,unknown,landscape,,WOS search

Changes in ash-free dry mass, C, and N were monitored at 2- to 6-month intervals at four replicate sites composed of patches of these three chaparral species. Three proximate C fractions were extracted from fresh and decomposing litter samples: polar and non-polar extractives (EXT), acid-solubles (ACID), and acid-insolubles (KLIG). The chemical structure of fresh and decomposed litter was additionally characterized using high-resolution solid-state C-13 NMR spectroscopy, while morphological properties were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After 2 y, the litters had lost between 20.7% +/- 1.2 (Ceanothus) and 35.2% +/- 6.8 (Quercus) of their original ash-free dry mass. The manzanita decomposed at a significantly faster rate than the other two litter types during the first few months of field exposure. Yet, after 2 y, mass loss was greater for the oak. Differences in decomposition rates could not be accounted for based on a single litter quality index. Fresh manzanita exhibited a significantly higher N content, which could explain its initially faster decay rate. Fresh oak litter, on the other hand, had a relatively high ACID and O-alkyl C (O-ALK) content, which may have been responsible for its decay pattern. Fresh ceanothus contained a relatively low KLIG content, yet it decomposed more slowly than the two other species. The solid-state C-13 NMR spectra of the ceanothus litter had two peaks characteristic of proanthocyanidins, which likely contributed to the recalcitrance of this litter type. SEM revealed that ceanothus leaf surfaces were left nearly unchanged after field exposure. In comparison, the oak and manzanita leaf surfaces were pitted and covered by microbial growth to the point of being unrecognizable. Taken together, our results indicate that a combination of biological, physical and chemical factors need to be examined to clarify the different decomposition rates and patterns of these three chaparral species.

Mean delta N-15 values-indicative of salmon-borne nutrients-were significantly higher in the O horizon and surface mineral soils downstream of barriers (near spawning reaches) than in soils upstream of barriers (near non-spawning reaches). However, the mean total N concentration in surface mineral soil was lower downstream than upstream. Mean foliar delta N-15 values were higher downstream for three plant species (Picea glauca, Salix alaxensis and Arctagrostis latifolia) with contrasting physiognomies. Mean overstory stem density was 100% higher downstream, primarily due to a fivefold difference in the density of largediameter willows (Salix spp.). Mean understory stem density was 47% lower downstream, also driven by a difference in willow density. Mean ground layer non-vascular and dwarf shrub species covers were 28% and 73% lower downstream, respectively. of the ten soil and vegetative characteristics that differed upstream to downstream, two (O horizon and Picea glauca delta N-15) were correlated with the density of spawning salmon.

In previous studies, experimental fertilization of moist acidic tussock tundra greatly increased the abundance and productivity of the deciduous dwarf shrub Betula nana. However, this species is largely absent from moist non-acidic tundra. These two common upland tundra community types exhibited markedly different responses to fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus. In moist acidic tundra, cover of deciduous shrubs (primarily B. nana) increased after only 2 years, and by 4 years vascular biomass and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) had increased significantly, almost entirely because of Betula. In moist non-acidic tundra, both biomass and ANPP were again significantly greater, but no single species dominated the response to fertilization. Instead, the effect was due to a combination of several small, sometimes statistically non-significant responses by forbs, graminoids and prostrate deciduous shrubs. The different growth form and species' responses suggest that fertilization will cause carbon cycling through plant biomass to diverge in these two tundra ecosystems. Already, production of new stems by apical growth has increased relative to leaf production in acidic tundra, whereas the opposite has occurred in non-acidic tundra. Secondary stem growth has also increased as a component of primary production in acidic tundra, but is unchanged in non-acidic tundra. Thus, fertilization will probably increase carbon sequestration in woody biomass of B. nana in acidic tundra, while increasing carbon turnover (but not storage) of non-woody species in non-acidic tundra. These results indicate that nutrient enrichment can have very different consequences for plant communities that occur on different geological substrates, because of differences in composition, even though they share the same regional species pool. Although the specific edaphic factors that maintain compositional differences in this case are unknown, variation in soil pH and related variability in soil nutrient availability may well play a role.",,,,,"Hobbie, Sarah/0000-0001-5159-031X",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,AUG,2005,93,4,,,,,770,782,,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01006.x,,,,,,,WOS:000230337900013,,,,,09/09/2020,422,empirical,vegetation change,abundance,"Northern Alaska, US",68.633,-149.717,factorial experiment,fertilisation; vegetation type,biotic; abiotic,Salix reticulata; Vaccinium uliginosum; Dryas integrifolia; Arctostaphylos alpina; Salix arctica; Ledum palustre; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Cassiope tetragona; Rhododendron lapponicum; Andromeda polifolia; Betula nana; Salix pulchra; Empetrum nigrum,13,community,,WOS search

This paper is focussed on three questions related to organic matter dynamics in small, forested streams of the conifer dominated Pacific Northwest: (1) How do small streams differ from large streams? (2) How do small streams of the Pacific Northwest differ from those of other regions? and (3) How do forest practices alter organic matter dynamics of small streams in the Pacific Northwest? The organic matter dynamics of small streams in this region differ from temperate deciduous forests in the nature of the organic matter deposited (protective chemicals, hard epidermis, slower loss rates), the timing of inputs (distributed throughout the year), and the transport rates (smaller, hard needles are more easily transported). The large amount and persistence of wood in these streams provides an additional source of organic matter that can be consumed by particular species and contributes to biofilm and fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) production. Logging is commonly practiced in many forests of the region. This practice has been shown to alter the type, amount, and timing of organic matter delivery to small streams and reduce the amount and size of large wood. Changes in channel complexity and water temperature after logging also can contribute to reduced organic matter storage. Many of the processes controlling organic matter dynamics in small streams are well described in other regions. However, the climate, vegetation, and topography of the Pacific Northwest suggest that the rates and nature of some processes affecting stream organic matter may differ considerably from other regions. Further research on small streams of this area will be required to better understand these differences.",,,,"Richardson, John/G-1513-2012","Richardson, John/0000-0001-8135-7447",,,,,,,,,,,,1093-474X,1752-1688,,,,AUG,2005,41,4,,,,,921,934,,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03777.x,,,,,,,WOS:000231549900009,,,,,09/09/2020,423,empirical,stream organic matter dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Nitrogen was added at 7, 35 and 70 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), with the highest dose corresponding to approximately 3.5 times the annual deposition in south-west Norway. 2 Both communities are dominated by lichens (Cladonia spp. and Cetraria spp., respectively), have a patchy structure and are 'conservative' as regards species content. 3 Lichens, which showed a decrease in cover and size, and after some years developed discoloured thalli, are the best organisms for monitoring changes in alpine vegetation that is exposed to increased nitrogen deposition. The most sensitive species in Cetrarietum nivalis appeared to be Alectoria nigricans and Cetraria ericetorum, but more abundant species (Cladonia mitis, C. stellaris and Cetraria nivalis) are likely to be more reliable indicators. Cetraria delisei seems to be a reliable indicator species for monitoring in Phyllodoco-Juncetum trifidi. 4 Fertilization had no significant effect on the vascular plants (dwarf shrubs and a few graminoids) in either community, except for Festuca ovina, the cover of which increased slightly. 5 Nitrogen pollution may affect oligotrophic, alpine communities differently, depending on their species composition and horizontal structure (patchiness). 6 It is suggested that other factors, such as climate, soil properties and community structure, may be more important than long-range nitrogen pollution for determining species composition and species cover in many of the oligotrophic, alpine communities in southern Norway.

Milder climatic conditions have occurred in northern Quebec, Canada, in the 20th century. The purpose of this study was to document the early signs of a northward expansion of the boreal forest into the subarctic forest-tundra, a vast heterogeneous ecotone. Colonization of upland tundra sites by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.) forming local subarctic tree lines was quantified at the biome scale. Because it was previously shown that the regenerative potential of spruce is reduced with increasing latitude, we predicted that tree line advances and recent establishment of seedlings above tree lines will also decrease northwards. Location Black spruce regeneration patterns were surveyed across a > 300-km latitudinal transect spanning the forest-tundra of northern Quebec, Canada (55 degrees 29'-58 degrees 27' N). Methods Elevational transects were positioned at forest-tundra interfaces in two regions from the southern forest-tundra and two regions from the northern forest-tundra, including the arctic tree line. The surroundings of stunted black spruce, forming the species limit in the shrub tundra, were also examined. Position, total height and origin (seed or layer) of all black spruce stems established in the elevational transects were determined. Dendrochronological and topographical data allowed recent subarctic tree line advances to be estimated. Age structures of spruce recently established from seed (< 2.5 m high) were constructed and compared between forest-tundra regions. Five to 20-year heat sum (growing degree-days, > 5 degrees C) and precipitation fluctuations were computed from regional climatic data, and compared with seedling recruitment patterns. Results During the 20th century, all tree lines from the southern forest-tundra rose slightly through establishment of seed-origin spruce, while some tree lines in the northern forest-tundra rose through height growth of stunted spruce already established on the tundra hilltops. However, the rate of rise in tree lines did not slow down with latitude. The density of < 2.5-m spruce established by seed declined exponentially with latitude. While the majority of < 2.5-m spruce has established since the late 1970s on the southernmost tundra hilltops, the regeneration pool was mainly composed of old, suppressed individuals in the northern forest-tundra. Spruce age generally decreased with increasing elevation in the southern forest-tundra stands, therefore indicating current colonization of tundra hilltops. Although spruce reproductive success has improved over the twentieth century in the southern forest-tundra, there was hardly any evidence that recruitment of seed-origin spruce was controlled by 5- to 20-year regional climatic fluctuations, except for winter precipitation. Main conclusions Besides the milder 20th century climate, local topographic factors appear to have influenced the rise in tree lines and recent establishment by seed. The effect of black spruce's semi-serotinous cones in trapping seeds and the difficulty of establishment on exposed, drought-prone tundra vegetation are some factors likely to explain the scarcity of significant correlations between tree establishment and climatic variables in the short term. The age data suggest impending reforestation of the southernmost tundra sites, although the development of spruce seedlings into forest might be slowed down by the harsh wind-exposure conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,,,,,MAY,2005,32,5,,,,,849,862,,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01182.x,,,,,,,WOS:000228751400010,,,,,09/09/2020,427,empirical,tree line dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Location: Alpine meadow and heath communities at Kilpisjarvi, sub-Arctic Finland. Methods: Control plots and three treatments were used to measure relative species abundances for five life cycle stages: standing vegetation, seed rain, seed bank and seedlings emerging in gaps and in closed vegetation. Results: The relative frequencies of plant traits varied between the life cycle stages. The meadows were dominated by weakly clonal herbs, small or intermediate seeds and unappendaged diaspores, while the heaths were dominated by clonal dwarf shrubs, small seeds and fleshy fruits. In the meadows, species with small seeds dominated during the seed rain and in the seedling stage in gaps, while species with intermediate seeds dominated the seed bank and the seedling stage in closed vegetation. Species with unappendaged diaspores dominated throughout the life cycle. In the heaths, seed bank and seedling stage were practically absent. Conclusions: The observed differences in plant trait spectra between life cycle stages indicate that important environmental factors differ among the stages. Small seeds are advantageous for dispersal. whereas intermediate seeds have a greater probability of germinating and establishing in closed vegetation.

The present study focuses oil the evaluation of the terrestrial biosphere component (TRIFFID) and its response to changes in climate and CO2 concentration. We also show how, by means of a diagnosis of the distribution of plant functional types according to climate parameters (soil temperature, winter temperature, growing-degree days, precipitation), it is possible to get better insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the biosphere model by reference to field knowledge of ecosystems. The model exhibits profound changes between the vegetation distribution at the Last Glacial Maximum and today that are generally consistent with palaeoclimate data, such as the disappearance of the Siberian boreal forest (taiga), an increase in shrub cover in Europe and an increase of the Subtropical desert area. The effective equatorial and sub-tropical tree area is reduced by 18%. There is also an increase in cover of wooded species in North-Western Africa and in Mexico. The analysis of bioclimatic relationships turns out to be an efficient method to infer the contributions of different climatic factors to vegetation changes, both at high latitudes, where the position of the boreal treeline appears in this model to be more directly constrained by the water stress than by summer temperature, and in semi-humid areas where the contributions of temperature and precipitation changes may partly compensate each other. Our study also confirms the major contribution of the decrease in CO2 to environmental changes and carbon storage through its selective impact on gross primary productivity of C3 and C4 plants and a reduction by 25% of water-use efficiency. Specifically, the reduction in CO2 concentration increases the amount of precipitation necessary to sustain at least 20% of grass fraction by 50 mm/year; the corresponding threshold for trees is increased by about 150 mm/year. As a consequence, a reduction in CO2 concentration considerably widens the climatic range where grasses and shrubs dominate. Crown Copyright (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Location Arctic tundra ecosystems of the North Slope of Alaska and the tundra-forest region of the Seward Peninsula, Alaska Methods We synthesize information from numerous studies on tundra and treeline ecosystems in an effort to document the spatial changes that occur across four arctic transitions. These transitions are: (i) the transition between High-Arctic and Low-Arctic systems, (ii) the transition between moist non-acidic tundra (MNT) and moist acidic tundra (MAT, also referred to as tussock tundra), (iii) the transition between tussock tundra and shrub tundra, (iv) the transition between tundra and forested systems. By documenting the nature of these spatial transitions, in terms of their environmental controls and vegetation patterns, we develop a conceptual model of temporal dynamics of arctic ecotones in response to environmental change. Results Our observations suggest that each transition is sensitive to a unique combination of controlling factors. The transition between High and Low Arctic is sensitive primarily to climate, whereas the MNT/MAT transition is also controlled by soil parent material, permafrost and hydrology. The tussock/shrub tundra transition appears to be responsive to several factors, including climate, topography and hydrology. Finally, the tundra/forest boundary responds primarily to climate and to climatically associated changes in permafrost. There were also important differences in the demography and distribution of the dominant plant species across the four vegetation transitions. The shrubs that characterize the tussock/shrub transition can achieve dominance potentially within a decade, whereas spruce trees often require several decades to centuries to achieve dominance within tundra, and Sphagnum moss colonization of non-acidic sites at the MNT/MAT boundary may require centuries to millennia of soil development. Main conclusions We suggest that vegetation will respond most rapidly to climatic change when (i) the vegetation transition correlates more strongly with climate than with other environmental variables, (ii) dominant species exhibit gradual changes in abundance across spatial transitions, and/or (iii) the dominant species have demographic properties that allow rapid increases in abundance following climatic shifts. All three of these properties characterize the transition between tussock tundra and low shrub tundra. It is therefore not surprising that of the four transitions studied this is the one that appears to be responding most rapidly to climatic warming.",,,,"Beringer, Jason/B-8528-2008","Beringer, Jason/0000-0002-4619-8361; Gould, William/0000-0002-3720-9735; Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,DEC,2004,31,12,,,,,1917,1933,,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01140.x,,,,,,,WOS:000225356000005,,,,,09/09/2020,431,meta-analysis,Arctic vegetation transitions,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Sequestration of carbon from atmospheric CO, in extensive, cold organic soils and the high albedo from low, snow-covered vegetation have had impacts on regional climate. However, many aspects of the functioning of Arctic ecosystems are sensitive to changes in climate and its impacts on biodiversity. The current Arctic climate results in slow rates of organic matter decomposition. Arctic ecosystems therefore tend to accumulate organic matter and elements despite low inputs. As a result, soil-available elements like nitrogen and phosphorus are key limitations to increases in carbon fixation and further biomass and organic matter accumulation. Climate warming is expected to increase carbon and element turnover, particularly in soils, which may lead to initial losses of elements but eventual, slow recovery. Individual species and species diversity have clear impacts on element inputs and retention in Arctic ecosystems. Effects of increased CO2 and UV-B on whole ecosystems, on the other hand, are likely to be small although effects on plant tissue chemisty, decomposition and nitrogen fixation may become important in the long-term. Cycling of carbon in trace gas form is mainly as CO2 and CH4. Most carbon loss is in the form of CO2, produced by both plants and soil biota. Carbon emissions as methane from wet and moist tundra ecosystems are about 5% of emissions as CO2 and are responsive to warming in the absence of any other changes. Winter processes and vegetation type also affect CH4 emissions as well as exchanges of energy between biosphere and atmosphere. Arctic ecosystems exhibit the largest seasonal changes in energy exchange of any terrestrial ecosystem because of the large changes in albedo from late winter, when snow reflects most incoming radiation, to summer when the ecosystem absorbs most incoming radiation. Vegetation profoundly influences the water and energy exchange of Arctic ecosystems. Albedo during the period of snow cover declines from tundra to forest tundra to deciduous forest to evergreen forest. Shrubs and trees increase snow depth which in turn increases winter soil temperatures. Future changes in vegetation driven by climate change are therefore, very likely to profoundly alter regional climate.",,,,"Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014; Oechel, Walter/M-1347-2019; Oechel, Walter C/F-9361-2010","Oechel, Walter C/0000-0002-3504-026X; Christensen, Torben/0000-0002-4917-148X",,,,,,,,,,,,0044-7447,1654-7209,,,,NOV,2004,33,7,,,,,448,458,,10.1639/0044-7447(2004)033[0448:EOTFOA]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,WOS:000225006300007,15573572,,,,09/09/2020,432,review,Arctic ecosystem function,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In order to clarify problems concerning the geochronology of glacier fluctuations we dated palacosols in moraines in the Kebnekaise mountain region of Swedish Lapland. These palaeosols already have been dated several years ago using bulk samples of the palaeosols and yielded ages of 6180-5790 and 2750-2100 cal yr BP. In an attempt to evaluate the sources of contamination associated with bulk samples these soils were re-dated by using Coleoptera fragments, Cenococcum geophilum spores, humic acids and woody plant tissues. The new dates reveal that the two palaeosols found within the moraines represent much longer periods of time than was previously assumed. Soil formation periods can be distinguished for periods 7800-7580, 6300-4080, 2450-2000 and 1170-740 cal yr BP. These age groups point to differentiated soil formation processes, resedimentation, bioturbation and/or cryoturbation. The results show that dated terrestrial macrofossils from glacial moraines indicate climate changes that are in accordance with other proxy records in northern and central Scandinavia and in certain times off-phase with glacier fluctuations in southern maritime Norway.

Based on 30 releves of 16 m(2) that include vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens, two new associations could be described belonging to the class Loiseleurio-Vaccinietea (order Rhododendro-Vaccinietalia): Rubo-Empetretum nigri and Carici-Empetretum nigri. The wind-sheltered Rubo-Empetretum nigri (alliance Phyllodoco-Vaccinion) mainly occurs in the lowlands on level terrain or sloping sites at lower foot slopes of mountains on deeper, mesic soil; this association is the zonal vegetation of the lowlands. Boreal, widespread and amphi-Beringian species are prominent in the distribution-type spectrum of the vascular plants. Two variants of Rubo-Empetretum nigri are described. A Geranium erianthum variant occurs on south-facing slopes and is rich in vascular plants species. A Plagiothecium undulatum variant is restricted to northern exposures and is rich in bryophytes and lichens. A Carici-Empetretum nigri (alliance Loiseleurio-Diapension) occurs on shallow soil on wind exposed sites at higher elevations in the mountains. It is very rich in lichen species of arctic-alpine distribution. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) suggests that altitude, nutrient content of the soil and exposition are the most important differential ecological factors. Soil depth, total carbon and nitrogen content, plant available phosphorus and all other measured cation contents are higher in Rubo-Empetretum than in Carici-Empetretum. Literature comparisons confirm the occurrence of both associations in other areas on the Southwest Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands.

However, few studies have actually addressed this question experimentally in the Arctic, and those that did found only little evidence for competition. Such species interactions will presumably become more important in the future, as Global Climate Change takes effect on terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated plant-plant interactions in the High Arctic, following the growth of Luzula confusa and Salix polaris in pure and mixed stands, and under elevated-temperature treatment over 2 years. To understand the mechanisms of competition, a parallel experiment was undertaken in phytotrons, manipulating competition, temperature and nutrient availability. Our findings indicate that competition is acting in the natural vegetation, and that climatic warming will alter the balance of interactions in favour of the dwarf shrub S. polaris. The phytotron experiment suggested that the mechanism is a higher responsiveness of Salix to nutrient availability, which increased under warming in the field. While Luzula showed a positive response to higher temperature in the lab, its performance in mixed stands in the field was actually reduced by warming, indicating a competitive repression of growth by Salix. The growth of Salix was also reduced by the presence of Luzula, but it was still able to profit from warming. Our findings suggest that climatic warming will result in greater shrub dominance of High Arctic tundra, but we also conjecture that grazing could reverse the situation to a graminoid-dominated tundra.

We used stepwise logistic regression to examine relationships between microhabitat use (i.e., captures among traps spaced at 40-m intervals) and 26 vegetative and structural habitat features measured in plots centered on trap stations. Seasonal (spring, autumn) models were created for two old-growth forest types: upland, western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)-Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) forests (upland-OG); and peatland-scrub-mixed-conifer forests (peatland-MC). Density of trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) >74 cm and abundance of Vaccinium were positively correlated with microhabitat use in peatland-MC during both seasons. During spring and autumn, the odds of capturing a flying squirrel increased by factors of 2.7 and 16.9, respectively, with an increase in mean density of 10 large trees/ha. Microhabitat use of upland-OG during autumn was positively correlated with density of snags with a dbh of 50-74 cm and negatively correlated with percentage cover of understory herbaceous vegetation; microhabitat use during spring was inversely correlated with percentage surface cover of water. At the macrohabitat (13-ha replicate of forest type) scale, large (>74-cm dbh) trees explained 65% of the variation in density between forest types; percent cover of moss and volume of down wood in decay classes I-IV explained 70% and 63-77% of the variation, respectively.

Comparison of burned and unburned plots showed significantly greater tree seedling abundance and an interactive effect between slope position and prescribed fire where the effect of fire on groundcover and tree seedlings differed by slope position. The increase in seedling abundance on burned plots was driven almost entirely by an 84-fold increase in yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulip-ifera L.) seedlings. Red oak (Quercus spp.) abundance was greater on mid- and upper-slope positions on burned plots, but white oak (Q. alba L.) abundance was lower in burned plots at every slope position. Abundance of herbs, shrubs, and vines was nearly 10% greater on burned plots. Prescribed fire caused community-level changes for seedlings and groundcover vegetation. Seedling species diversity and evenness were relatively low at lower slope positions because of the copious germination of yellow-polar, but increased at higher slope positions. Conversely, groundcover diversity and evenness was relatively low on upper slope positions due to the abundant sprouting of lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium vacillans Torrey). Overall, groundcover diversity and evenness were higher for lower slope positions. Groundcover diversity was significantly altered by the interaction of prescribed fire and slope position. Results of this study suggest that one low-intensity prescribed fire in upland hardwood stands can alter tree regeneration patterns and composition of the groundcover layer at least temporarily, but its potential for the long-term promotion of oak-hickory regeneration and suppression of mesic hardwoods on these sites remains unclear.

However, responses of regional treelines to climatic trends over the last century do not show any clear trends. We hypothesize that these equivocal responses may partly be caused by limitation of dispersal and/or recruitment that is species-specific to particular trees with potentially expanding ranges. 2 To test this hypothesis, we established and parameterized a temporally and spatially explicit model of plant spread and analysed its sensitivity to: (a) variation in predicted climatic trends; (b) the spatial distribution of recruits around a seed source; and (c) variation in the resistance of resident non-woody vegetation to invasion. We used data from a high mountain landscape of the Northern Calcareous Alps in Austria where the treeline is dominated by Pinus mugo Turra, a shrubby pine. 3 Low growth rates and long generation times, together with considerable dispersal and recruitment limitation, resulted in an overall slow range expansion under various climate-warming scenarios. 4 Running the model for 1000 years predicted that the area covered by pines will increase from 10% to between 24% and 59% of the study landscape. 5 The shape of the dispersal curve and spatial patterns of competitively controlled recruitment suppression affect range size dynamics at least as severely as does variation in assumed future mean annual temperature (between 0 degreesC and 2 degreesC above the current mean). Moreover, invasibility and shape of the dispersal curve interact with each other due to the spatial patterns of vegetation cover in the region. 6 Ambiguous transient responses of individual treeline systems may thus originate not only from variation in regional climatic trends but also from differences in species' dispersal and recruitment behaviour and in the intensity and pattern of resistance of resident alpine vegetation to invasion.",,,,,"Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887; Dirnbock, Thomas/0000-0002-8294-0690",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,APR,2004,92,2,,,,,241,252,,10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00872.x,,,,,,,WOS:000220382500005,,,,,09/09/2020,440,modelling,tree line dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Landslides and debris flows transported sediment and woody debris in headwater tributaries in 1961, 1979, and 1993. Widespread landsliding in 1961 and 1993 was triggered by rainstonns with recurrence intervals (24 h precipitation) of 7.0 years and 4.2 years respectively. Occurrence. distribution, and downstream effects of these mass movements were controlled by landform characteristics such as channel gradient and valley configuration. Landslides and channelized debris flows created exposed bedrock reaches, log jams, fans, and abandoned channels. The terminus of the deposits did not enter main channels because debris flows spread and thinned on the unconfined bottom of the U-shaped glaciated valley. Chronic sediment input to channels included surface erosion of exposed till (rain splash, sheet erosion, and freeze-thaw action) and bank failures. Bedload sediment transport in a channel impacted by 1993 landslides and debris flows was two to ten times greater and relatively finer compared with bedload transport in a young alder riparian channel that had last experienced a landslide and debris flow in 1961. Sediment transport and storage were influenced by regeneration of riparian vegetation, storage behind recruited woody debris, development of a streambed armour layer, and the decoupling of hillslopes and channels.

Restoration of native plant communities on previously disturbed land requires the identification and modification of environmental factors that impede or restrict ecosystem succession or development. One of the key factors in successful reclamation is to ensure colonization and persistence of native species within an area. Therefore, the identification of microsite types that favour colonization by native species should improve our ability to successfully reclaim degraded areas. 2. The objectives of this study were to (i) identify and describe microsite types that were conducive to the establishment of five native plant species (Euphrasia frigida, Galium normanii, Thymus praecox, Cerastium spp. and Rumex acetosa) on degraded and reclaimed sites in Iceland; and (ii) to determine the effects of reclamation activities that included the application of manure and inorganic fertilizer on the distribution of microsite types and seedling establishment. Reclamation sites of different ages were examined on an eroded area where the target community was a grass or shrub heath. 3. The spatial distribution of plant establishment was not random but varied among microsite types and study sites. More seedlings than expected were found in microsite types characterized by small rocks and biological soil crusts. These may have entrapped seed and provided more soil stability and moisture than other microsite types. The cover of these microsite types varied among the study sites but the pattern of seedling establishment among the five native forbs was similar. 4. Synthesis and applications. Practical reclamation methods are improved by identifying those factors that promote successful seedling establishment by native species. Application of fertilizer without additional seeding proved to be a simple reclamation approach that increased the availability of one favourable microsite type, enhanced the establishment of native species and subsequently allowed vegetation cover to expand. Seed of native plants may be difficult to obtain commercially, but this approach can be used on degraded land where propagules are available but recovery is slowed by soil instability or nutrient limitations.",,,,"Aradottir, Asa/A-6041-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,OCT,2003,40,5,,,,,815,823,,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00848.x,,,,,,,WOS:000185552400005,,,,,09/09/2020,443,empirical,post-disturbance succession,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

This episode may be synchronous with the decline in delta(18)O values in the Greenland ice-cores. It also correlates with a short, cold event detected in marine cores from the North Atlantic that has been ascribed to a weakening of thernohaline circulation associated with the sudden drainage of Lake Agassiz into the northwest Atlantic, or, alternatively, a period with distinctly decreased solar forcing. The vegetation sequence begins at ca. 10 500 cal. yr BP with a succession from tundra to shrub-tundra and increasing lake productivity. Rapid population increases of aquatic plants suggest high summer temperatures between 10 450 and 10 380 cal. yr BP. High pollen percentages, concentrations and influx of Betula, Juniperus and Salix together with macrofossil leaves indicate shrub growth around the site during the initial phases of vegetation colonisation. Unstable conditions followed ca. 10 380 cal. yr BP that changed both the upland vegetation and the aquatic plant communities. A decrease in percentage values of shrub pollen is recorded, with replacement of both aquatics and herbaceous plants by pioneer plant communities. An increase in total pollen accumulation rates not seen in the concentration data suggests increased sediment delivery. The catchment changes are consistent with less seasonal, moister conditions. Subsequent climatic amelioration reinitiated a warmth-driven succession and catchment stabilisation, but retained high precipitation levels influencing the composition of the post-event communities.

These communities responded quite differently to the same manipulations, and species responded individualistically within communities and among sites. For example, moist acidic tundra is primarily nitrogen (N)-limited, whereas wet sedge tundra is primarily phosphorus (P)-limited, and the magnitude of growth responses varies across sites within communities. Here we report results of four years of manipulated nutrients (N and/or P) and/or air temperature in an understudied, diverse plant community, moist non-acidic tussock tundra, in northern Alaska. Our goals were to determine which factors limit above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and biomass, how community composition changes may affect ecosystem attributes, and to compare these results with those from other communities to determine their generality. Although relative abundance of functional groups shifted in several treatments, the only significant change in community-level ANPP and biomass occurred in plots that received both N and P, driven by an increase in graminoid biomass and production resulting from a positive effect of adding N. There was no difference in community biomass among any other treatments; however, some growth forms and individual species did respond. After four years no one species has come to dominate the treatment plots and species richness has not changed. These results are similar to studies in dry heath, wet sedge, and moist acidic tundra where community biomass had the greatest response to both N and P and warming results were more subtle. Unlike in moist acidic tundra where shrub biomass increased markedly with fertilization, our results suggest that in non-acidic tundra carbon sequestration in plant biomass will not increase substantially under increased soil nutrient conditions because of the lack of overstory shrub species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,,,,,OCT,2003,103,1,,,,,204,216,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12363.x,,,,,,,WOS:000186118000021,,,,,09/09/2020,445,empirical,vegetation changes,abundance; biomass; recruitment,"Northern Alaska, US",68.633,-149.6,factorial experiment,temperature; fertilisation,abiotic,Salix reticulata; Vaccinium uliginosum; Dryas integrifolia; Arctostaphylos alpina; Cassiope tetragona; Rhododendron lapponicum,6,community,,WOS search

At this site, soil conditions vary considerably along with the progress of primary succession within a small area. We compared growth forms and delta(13)C values, which reflect long-term leaf gas exchange characteristics, of plants growing in different successional stages with different soil conditions. Even though the soil mass water content (water mass/dry mass) increased from 10% to 140% with the progress of succession, the water and nitrogen content of the soil had negligible effects on the delta(13)C values of the observed species. The delta(13)C values were determined mainly by species and growth forms. We compared two morphs of S. oppositifolia, the prostrate form (P-form) and the cushion form (C-form), on the same riverbank in the glacier foreland. Regardless of the successional stage, the delta(13)C values of the C-form were about 2parts per thousand more negative than those of the P-form. The ground cover area per plant mass (GA) of the C-form was less than 30% that of the P-form, and the product of GA and stomatal conductance appears to be an important factor in the relationship between transpiration and photosynthesis of a whole plant. We suggest that the relationship between GA and the root mass fraction is a crucial factor affecting the water utilization in high arctic environments.

However, investigations into the impact of temperature on high arctic plants rarely separate out the role of air and soil temperatures, and few data exist to indicate whether soil temperatures alone can significantly influence the growth of high arctic vascular plants in a manner that might direct community composition. We examined the response of high arctic plants of three functional types (grasses, sedges/rushes and non-graminoids) to manipulated soil temperature under common air temperature conditions. Target plants, within intact soil cores, were placed in water baths at a range of temperatures between 4.9 and 15.3degreesC for one growing season. Grasses responded most rapidly to increased soil temperature, with increased total live plant mass. above-ground live mass and total below-ground live mass, with non-graminoids having the lowest, and sedges/ rushes an intermediate degree of response. The ratio of above-ground live mass to total live mass increased in all growth forms. Grasses. in particular, responded to enhanced soil temperatures by increasing shoot size rather than shoot number. In all growth forms the mass of root tissue beneath the moss layer increased significantly and to a similar extent with increasing soil temperature. These results clearly indicate that different growth forms, although collected from the same plant community, respond differently to changes in soil temperature. As a consequence, factors influencing soil temperature in high arctic ecosystems, such as global climate change or herbivory (which leads to reduced moss depth and increased soil temperatures), may also direct chances in vascular plant community composition.",,,,"van der Wal, Rene/F-3177-2010; Brooker, Rob W/F-9569-2012","Brooker, Rob W/0000-0002-7014-0071",,,,,,,,,,,,1100-9233,1654-1103,,,,AUG,2003,14,4,,,,,535,542,,10.1658/1100-9233(2003)014[0535:CSTDTC]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,WOS:000186226400008,,,,,09/09/2020,448,empirical,community structure,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In GAAR the southern lakes (similar to67degreesN) and those in the Brooks Range foothills are in watersheds with taiga and tundra vegetation. The northern lakes (similar to68degreesN) are at higher elevations in the Brooks Range in watersheds that lie wholly beyond the treeline. Average sum of the cations for all takes matches the world average for fresh waters and the average for drainage from tundra and taiga landscapes. Local lithography explains the measured decrease in calcium equivalents and silica, and an increase in magnesium with altitude because of more calcareous rock in the southern basins at low altitude and shale/conglomerate in northern mountain catchments. In most low altitude takes Secchi depth was located in sub-surface algal peaks at temperatures averaging similar to8.5 C cooler than the surface, typically with double the surface chlorophyll value. Mineral turbidity, and less so color, controlled transparency in several high altitude lakes where turbid inflows were a factor. Lakes were oligotrophic based on nutrients and algal chlorophyll, but a doubling of TP and concurrent halving of TN was measured in GAAR lakes with altitude. Both patterns were correlated with the decreasing density of terrestrial vegetation with altitude, resulting in a sharp decline in the TN:TP ratio. This pattern suggests sources of these nutrients change across the landscape continuum within GAAR described by altitude and vegetation zones. Nitrogen fixation associated with terrestrial vegetation most likely accounts for greater TN in lakes within the taiga and moist or wet tundra, whereas TN levels approximated the N content of regional rainfall in high elevation lakes with predominately barren land and prostrate shrub in the catchments. Ratios of TN:TP and Nutrient Stimulation Bioassays suggest P limitation was likely among low altitude lakes and N limitation increased in importance in takes at high altitude.

Peatland formation occurs through two mechanisms: (i) terrestrialization, when a water body fills with sediments and peat; and (ii) paludification, the conversion of dry land to peatland. In temperate regions, where high summer temperatures may limit peat accumulation, general models of peatland development suggest that allogenic factors such as climate change control peatland development and that terrestrialization is the primary mechanism of formation. 2 This study evaluates this widely accepted model by comparing the developmental histories of three peatlands within the same climate region in New England in order to: (i) describe the development and timing of successional events among peatlands; (ii) document the roles of paludification and terrestrialization as developmental mechanisms; and (iii) evaluate the importance of climate change vs. autogenic factors in peatland development in this temperate region. 3 Basin morphometry, sediment stratigraphies, and chronologies of community change determined through radiocarbon dating indicate that peatland development at each site involved terrestrialization followed by paludification, with no apparent influence of broad-scale climate change on the timing of these processes. Paludification was consistently initiated coincident with the consolidation of a shrub mat across each lake-basin, and was controlled in extent and rate by the topography of the adjoining uplands. The timing of stratigraphic changes varied among sites, suggesting that autogenic factors associated with the accumulation of peat rather than regional climate change controlled development. These results provide the foundation for a model of temperate peatland development driven by autogenic factors and caution against the use of temperate peatland development as a proxy for climatic reconstruction.",,,,"Williams, K/A-6361-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,,,,,FEB,2003,91,1,,,,,68,76,,10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00740.x,,,,,,,WOS:000180744300007,,,,,09/09/2020,450,modelling,peatland development,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Classified as a mineral-poor fen owing to deep, water-logged peats that are influenced to a limited extent by groundwater, the ecosystem is dominated by plants such as sedges (Carex spp.) and evergreen shrubs. Ten automatic chambers measured fluxes every 3 h by sampling changes in headspace concentration of CO2 from November 2000 through March 2001. The fen was covered in snow for most of this period and CO2 was emitted from the snow pack throughout the winter. The largest fluxes were associated with ground temperatures of 0 degreesC and with declining atmospheric pressure. CO2 effluxes up to 3 mumol m(-2) s(-1) were recorded when the ground temperature reached the thaw point. Fluxes were lower when the ground temperature rose above 0 degreesC, however, suggesting that the large fluxes were associated with a build up and release of stored CO2 degassing as soon as the ground thawed, or by enhanced microbial activity associated with freeze-thaw dynamics. The large number of thaw events coupled with frequent short-term releases of CO2 suggest that degassing occurred on a regular basis with changes in atmospheric pressure and/or microbial decomposition occurred beneath the snowpack. The extent of soil freezing prior to thaw was also an important factor, with colder soils yielding smaller CO2 emissions upon thaw. Although most of the observed CO2 flux was efflux from the ecosystem, occasional CO2 uptake by the ecosystem of up to 1 mumol m(-2) s(-1) was also observed, indicating small rates of photosynthesis even during winter. Photosynthesis occurred only when the ground temperature was >0 degreesC. The implications for a warmer climate are unclear. If warmer winter temperatures yield less snow in the temperate region, then soils could freeze more deeply and result in lower CO2 emissions. However, if less snow results in a higher frequency of freeze-thaw events, then winter CO2 emissions could be larger with a warmer climate.

Our results suggest that environmental factors in the disturbed habitat are more favorable for the disease through increased growth of the host V. vitis-idaea and possibly by increased growth and reproduction of the pathogen. The high emergence rate of new V vitis-idaea ramets in the disturbed habitat resulted in a younger ramet age structure as compared with the undisturbed habitat. Consequently, the ratio of growing to nongrowing ramets was higher in the disturbed habitat. We consider growth to be a prerequisite for V. vitis-idaea becoming infected. Thus, a low amount of growing ramets may be seen as a characteristic of undisturbed V. vitis-idaea stands, which buffers the plant against E. splendidum.

Moreover, temperature limits growth more severely than it limits photosynthesis over the temperature range 5-20 degreesC. If it is assumed that growth and reproduction are controlled by temperature, a rapid advance of the tree line would be predicted, Indeed, some authors have provided photographic evidence and remotely sensed data that suggest this is, in fact, occurring.

Mean leaf number was significantly lower inside canopies compared to outside for one species. Mean seed weight was significantly lower inside canopies for one species. Removal of Salix lapponum shrubs increased bulbil weight of Bistorta vivipara and seed number and plant weight of Euphrasia frigida. These results suggest that canopy removal relaxed competition. Shoot density was substantially higher outside canopies compared to inside for four species and slightly higher outside for one species. Soil moisture, soil organic content, soil pH, and temperature inside canopies were not significantly different from outside, whereas photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was markedly reduced inside canopies. Increased growth inside canopies is likely a compensatory mechanism to decreased PAR, which enable plants inside canopies to achieve reproductive outputs that equals those on outside plants.

We also examined synecological differences in terms of community characteristics (e.g. growth form distributions, species richness, soil pH and climatic affinities, phytogeographic patterns) to better understand ecological alteration processes and changing species compositions along successional gradients. Data were collected along a transect from the Brooks Range to Prudhoe Bay, primarily in the watersheds of Sagavanirktok River and Kuparuk River.

A combination of edaphic conditions (soil pH, soil moisture) and factors related to topography, disturbance regime and landscape evolution (river terrace/stream bank development) controls spatial patterns and floristic compositions of riparian plant communities. Classification resulted in three associations and four subassociations, each occupying distinct riparian habitats, and, thus, indicating distinct environmental conditions.

This tall willow association indicates sites with frequent disturbances and coarser-textured, relatively dry, initial alluvial soils with basic reaction that have deep active layers and relatively high soil temperatures. The association may persist on river banks as long as erosion and deposition of new increments of alluvium occurs, i.e. as long as predominantly allogenic processes are operative in succession cycles. It is characterized by relatively low species richness, p considerable percentage of North American endemics, higher amount of more thermophilous species and comparatively higher cover percentage of forbs. Higher terraces show the paradoxon of better developed soils and decreasing productivity of the shrub layer. With decreasing river influence and the transition to finer-textured, more nutrient-rich, less basic soils, the tall willow community is replaced by the Anemono-Salicetum richardsonii ass. nov. (subass. lupinetosum arctici). Decreasing active layer depth, caused by the insulation of a thick moss layer and consequently lower soil temperatures, as well as lower root activity and rooting space, and higher soil moisture reduce the competitiveness of Salix alaxensis-stands and are thus key factors for this successional replacement with low willows. The Anemono-Salicetum richardsonii characterizes later stages of succession on river alluvium with predominantly autogenic processes resulting inter alia in an uniquely arctic soil thermal regime. Shrubs and mosses are dominant growth forms in this association, which is further characterized by comparatively highest species richness. It also occurs on upland tundra stream banks (subass. salicetosum pulchrae), where environmental conditions and floristic composition point to a certain affinity to the Valeriano-Salicetum pulchrae ass. nov, The latter association is distributed on older, long-deglaciated land surfaces with paludified, loamy, acid soils with massive ground ice and thick moss layers, resulting in cold soils, decreased depth of thaw, and increased soil moisture. It typically occupies the immediate margins of smaller tundra streams and creeks with a specific streamflow regime (low disturbance level), originating in the gentle topography of the foothills. Water saturation of the soils lead to reduced decomposition of organic residues and thus to high contents of organic matter. Percentage of acidophilous species and of more cold-adapted species as well as moss cover and bryophyte species richness are comparatively very high. This terminal riparian vegetation type seems to be connected to long-established hydrologic patterns and associated riparian ecosystem evolution along headwaters in upland tundra, and has developed in other time scales compared to the above associations. Due to synecological and physiognomic correspondences and floristic similarities in supraregional and circumpolar perspective, North Alaskan riparian willow associations can be assigned to existing higher syntaxonomic units of the Braun-Blanquet system, established in Europe and Greenland. Strong affinities do exist to alluvial willow associations of the Salicetea purpureae. We propose to extend the range of this class to the North American Arctic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-269X,,,,,JUN 27,2002,32,2,,,,,145,204,,10.1127/0340-269X/2002/0032-0145,,,,,,,WOS:000176615400001,,,,,09/09/2020,457,empirical,vegetation associations,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Our objective was to assess the responses of plant and insect herbivore communities to these treatments, and to determine how vegetation responses scale-up to those of a second trophic group. 2 There were strong effects of nutrient addition on the above-ground biomass of both dominant (dwarf shrubs) and subordinate (grasses and mosses) plant functional groups, with responses by the latter being of greater magnitude. Responses to temperature were less frequent and of a smaller magnitude. 3 There were marked changes in the abundance of insect herbivores in response to the treatments. Changes in the above-ground biomass of subordinate plant species had a greater impact on the composition of the insect herbivore community than the smaller responses of dominant dwarf shrubs. For example, the abundance of a moss-feeding Heteropteran in fertilized plots was as little as 6% that of controls, while Homoptera specializing on grasses were over 400% more abundant. In addition, gramnivorous taxa. (the Delphacidae) were present only in those plots that received nutrients. 4 Despite some species-specific effects of the perturbations on the quality of dwarf shrub annual shoots (defined as the concentrations of nitrogen and phenolic compounds), little change in leaf herbivory was observed. Insect herbivores removed less than 1% of annual biomass from dominant dwarf shrub species. 5 It is proposed that insect community change was driven by subordinate plant groups and not by the dominant dwarf shrub species, suggesting a wider importance of subordinate species for community structure.",,,,"Richardson, Sarah/D-3353-2015","Richardson, Sarah/0000-0002-4097-0381; Hartley, Sue/0000-0002-5117-687X",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,,,,,JUN,2002,90,3,,,,,544,556,,10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00681.x,,,,,,,WOS:000175666900012,,,,,09/09/2020,458,empirical,forest vegetation changes,biomass,"Abisko, SE",68,19,factorial experiment,temperature; fertilisation,abiotic,,unknown,community,,WOS search

In continental lichen heaths in the inland with nutrient-poor conditions, however, slowly decomposable dwarf shrubs are favoured by grazing. According to a hypothesis, by favouring easily decomposing plants in nutrient-rich conditions and slowly decomposing plants in nutrient-poor conditions, herbivory enhances soil nutrient cycling in nutrient-rich and retards it in nutrient-poor areas. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the impact of reindeer grazing on soil C and N mineralization between two oceanic and two continental arctic-alpine tundra heaths. Although soil respiration and microbial metabolic activity were enhanced by grazing in the suboceanic but not in the subcontinental tundra heaths, gross N mineralization rates were higher in the grazed areas in soils from all study sites, indicating that reindeer grazing leads to increased rates of nutrient cycling in both nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich tundra heaths. Thus, in the subcontinental tundra heaths, the increase in soil N concentrations due to mammalian waste products enhances N mineralization rates, even though the organic C quality is not improved by reindeer grazing. There was some site-specific variation in the strength of the reindeer effects on various microbial processes and soil properties, which can be related to spatial variation in grazing intensity and timing, as these factors in turn affect the nutrient sink strength of the vegetation.",,,,"Stark, Sari/L-4440-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,,,,,APR,2002,97,1,,,,,69,78,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970107.x,,,,,,,WOS:000176022200007,,,,,09/09/2020,459,empirical,nutrient dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

The effects of global climate change are predicted to be strongest in the Arctic. This, as well as the suitability of tundra as a simple model ecosystem, has led to many field experiments investigating consequences of simulated environmental change. 2. On the basis of 36 experiments reviewed here, minor light attenuation by clouds, small changes in precipitation, and increases in UV-B radiation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations will not affect arctic plants in the short term. However, temperature elevation, increases in nutrient availability and major decreases in light availability will cause an immediate plant-growth response and alter nutrient cycling, possibly creating positive feedbacks on plant biomass. The driver of future change in arctic vegetation is likely to be increased nutrient availability, arising for example from temperature-induced increases in mineralization. 3. Arctic plant species differ widely in their response to environmental manipulations. Classification into plant functional types proved largely unsatisfactory for generalization of responses and predictions of effects. 4. Nevertheless. a few generalizations and consistent differences between PFTs were detected. Responses to fertilization were the strongest, particularly in grasses. Shrubs and grasses were most responsive to elevated temperature. 5. Future studies should focus on interactive effects or environmental factors, investigate long-term responses to manipulations, and incorporate interactions with other trophic levels.

Four dated samples (three Late Pleistocene, one Holocene) rich in plant macrofossils were analysed with respect to their floristic composition. The flora of the Holocene sample is similar to the recent plant cover in the study area and is mainly characterized by subarctic and high arctic dwarf-shrubs and hydrophytes. The Pleistocene samples, radiocarbon dated to ca. 30, 27 and 18 ka BP, reflect a species-rich vegetation. The high proportion of pioneer plants within these samples indicates frequent disturbances of the vegetation cover. Furthermore, an almost complete absence of hydrophytes and swamp plants and the dominance of xerophytes, respectively, are typical for the Pleistocene vegetation from the Cape Sabler section. The presence of the tundra-steppe Crassulaceae Orostachys spinosa gives evidence for extremely cryoxeric climatic conditions in the Central Taymyr Peninsula during the Late Pleistocene. The species composition of the Pleistocene samples thus proves the predominance of a continental climate during the Weichselian, which was characterized by a decreased cloud cover, and thus increased direct solar radiation reaching the ground and extreme annual temperature variations. That would have entailed higher summer temperatures, lower precipitation, and longer vegetation periods (due to shorter snowmelt), thus, better conditions than today for the growth of plants in the study area. The higher species diversity in the Weichselian samples confirms this assumption. All these factors caused mainly aerobic soil environments and favourable conditions for seasonal heating of soils.

The present study attempts to experimentally test this hypothesis. We examined the effect that manure composition from brown bears (Ursus arctos), important seed dispersers of Rubus spectabilis and Vaccinium ovalifolium/alaskaense in the temperate rainforests of Southeast Alaska, has on seedling emergence and growth of these two fleshy-fruited species in their natural habitat. The seeds of Rubus spectabilis showed a significantly higher germination rate in manure composed of animal material (mainly deer hair and bones) than in manure consisting of either fruit pulp or vegetation fiber and than in controls (potting soil with no manure added). The final number of germinated Rubus seeds was similar between the animal material and the fruit pulp treatments, perhaps due to similar water retention capacities, but was significantly higher than in the vegetation fiber treatment and the control. The germination patterns of Vaccinium seeds, in contrast, appeared to be unaffected by the composition of manure in which they were embedded. Seedlings of both species grew faster, and in the case of Rubus produced more leaves, when manure consisted of animal material. A principal constituent of bone is calcium phosphate, which may provide important minerals to growing plants. Manure containing vegetation fiber also enhanced seedling growth compared to manure with fruit pulp or the control. For Rubus, manure with fruit pulp did not affect seedling length significantly, although the number of leaves per seedling was greater in this treatment than in the control. We conclude that the influence of frugivores on the final fate of seeds of fleshy-fruited plants appears to depend not only upon commonly considered factors such as distance of dispersal, treatment in the digestive tract, and location of deposition, but also on what material the dispersed seeds are embedded in, i.e., on what other food frugivores have consumed along with the fruits.",,,,"Traveset, Anna V/D-7802-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,1385-0237,,,,,JUL,2001,155,1,,,,,29,34,,10.1023/A:1013282313035,,,,,,,WOS:000172718700003,,,,,09/09/2020,464,empirical,forest understorey shrub germination and growth,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In the eastern part of China, the PFTs of trees determine mostly the physiognomy of landscape. Biomes range from boreal deciduous coniferous forest/woodland, boreal mixed forest/woodland, temperate mixed forest, temperate broad-leaved deciduous forest, warm-temperate broad-leaved evergreen/mixed forest, warm-temperate/cool-temperate evergreen coniferous forest, xeric woodland/scrub, to tropical seasonal and rain forest, and tropical deciduous forest from north to south. In the northern and western part of China, grass is the dominant PFT. From northeast to west and southwest the biomes range from moist savannas, tall grassland, short grassland, dry savannas, arid shrubland/steppe, desert, to alpine tundra/ice/polar desert. Comparisons between the classification introduced here and the four classifications which were established over the past two decades, i.e. the vegetation classification, the vegetation division, the physical ecoregion, and the initial biome classification have showed that the different aims of biome classifications have resulted in different biome schemes each with its own unique characteristics and disadvantages for global change study. The new biome classification relies not only on climatic variables, but also on soil factor, vegetation functional variables, ecophysiological parameters and competition among the PFTs. It is a comprehensive classification that using multivariables better expresses the vegetation distribution and can be compared with world biome classifications.

J,"Andrews, P; O'Brien, EM",,,,"Andrews, P; O'Brien, EM",,,"Climate, vegetation, and predictable gradients in mammal species richness in southern Africa",JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many hypotheses have been proposed to account for geographic variations in species diversity. In general these relate to some aspect of climate, particularly climatic variables measuring available or potential energy, but while these relate directly to plant diversity they may only indirectly affect mammal species richness. We have examined these relationships by mapping and correlating mammal species richness in southern Africa (n = 285 species) with 15 climatic variables, two topographic variables, and woody plant species richness (n = 1359 species). The effect of area on richness was held a constant by using an equal-area grid cell matrix superimposed on species range maps, with each grid cell equal to 25 000 km(2). We found that variability in the plant species richness alone accounts for 75% of the variability in mammal species richness. Of the climatic variables, only thermal seasonality approaches this figure, accounting for 69% of the variability, while annual measures of temperature, precipitation or energy account for only 14-35% of variability. Differences from North American mammal diversity studies, where annual temperature, and hence annual potential evapotranspiration (PET), have been found to be more important, are attributed in part to southern Africa's climate and vegetation being largely temperate to tropical, as opposed to temperate to polar in North America. By distinguishing different types of mammal based on size, spatial and dietary guilds, other differences emerge. Strong correlations with annual temperature exist only for large mammals, accounting for 60-67% of the variability in species richness of large mammals compared with <20% for small mammals. Small mammals are strongly correlated with other climatic or vegetation parameters, especially plant richness and thermal seasonality; frugivorous and insectivorous mammal richness is correlated with thermal seasonality and minimum monthly PET; and arboreal and aerial species richness is correlated with plant richness, thermal seasonality and minimum monthly PET. Up to 77% of the variability in richness of arboreal, frugivorous and insectivorous species can be explained by woody plant richness, compared with only 38-48% of the variability in terrestrial herbivores. It is clear from this that different kinds of mammals are differentially affected by climatic and environmental factors, and this explains some of the discrepancies found in earlier studies where no distinction was made between different sizes or guilds of mammal. This result has implications both for the conservation of mammalian communities at the present time and for understanding the evolution and structure of mammalian communities in the past.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0952-8369,,,,,JUN,2000,251,,2,,,,205,231,,10.1111/j.1469-7998.2000.tb00605.x,,,,,,,WOS:000088014900007,,,,,09/09/2020,467,modelling,South Africa mammal richness,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Dominant species were recorded by estimating the cover percentage of all taxa in the different plant communities. The following habitat factors were estimated: rock type and texture, occurrence of limonite crusts and guano, and moisture conditions. The lichen flora of the three localities, which differ from each other climatically, is compared. The coastal locality, Qeqertarsuatsiaat, is characterised by its conspicuous ornithocoprophilous lichen vegetation consisting of species such as Aspicilia caesiocinerea, Physcia caesia, Protoparmelia badia and Xanthoria elegans and a particular community of lichens tolerant of high concentrations of iron, for example, Acarospora smaragdula, A. sinopica and Tremolecia atrata. Well developed snowbeds dominated by Salix herbacea, Cladonia ecmocyna, Peltigera scabrosa and Solorina crocea are of great importance on the Qeqertarsuatsiaq island. Empetrum hermaphroditum-Vaccinium uliginosum heaths rich in fell-field lichens such as Alectoria ochroleuca, Bryocaulon divergens and Flavocetraria nivalis also occur in many places on this island. Epiphytic lichens are of minor importance at Qeqertarsuatsiaat. The comparatively warm summers at Qussuk favours the development of scrub vegetation. Accordingly the epiphytic lichen flora, represented by species such as Cetraria sepincola, Lecanora fuscescens, Parmeliopsis ambigua and Varicellaria rhodocarpa, is more rich at this locality than at Qeqertarsuatsiaat. Mixed dwarf shrub heaths dominated by Betula nana, Empetrum hermaphroditum, Ledum groenlandicum and L. palustre. Vaccinium uliginosum and rich in macrolichens such as Cladonia stellaris, C. stygia, C. mitis and Stereocaulon paschale are widely distributed at Qussuk. The lichens form almost pure lichen heaths in the area. More dry heaths and fell-fields with Flavocetraria nivalis. Sphaerophorus globosus and species of Alectoria occur on hills and in other less protected places. Seepage rocks support lichens such as Ephebe hispidula, Massalongia carnosa, Polychidium muscicola and Vestergrenopsis isidiata. Contrary to lichens associated with iron-containing crusts ornithocoprophilous lichens and lichens occurring on dry, gneissic rocks without guano are of great importance at Qussuk. The richest epiphytic lichen flora was found on Alnus crispa and Betula nana near the head of Sangujaarssuit. The two shrub species have many lichens in common, for example, Arthopyrenia punctiformis, Lecanora fuscescens, Melanelia septentrionalis and Parmeliopsis ambigua. Phaeocalicium compressulum is a typical epiphyte on Alnus. Normal terricolous lichens such as Caloplaca ammiospila, Cladonia cyanipes and Psoroma hypnorum often colonize the basal parts of the shrubs. Many Peltigeras, for example, Peltigera kristinssonii and P. leucophlebia, grow among mosses such as Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi in open scrubs composed of Alnus crispa or Salix glauca. Heath mosaics composed of Betula nana. Empetrum hermaphroditum, Ledum groenlandicum, Salix glauca and Vaccinium uliginosum are rich in lichens such as Buellia papillata and Nephroma expallidum. A Salix herbacea-Sibbaldia procumbens snowbed appears to be rich in lichens characterised by a mainly coastal distribution in Greenland (for example, Pertusaria oculata and Solorina crocea).

The simulated biome was basically in good agreement with a potential natural vegetation map based on a numerical comparison between two maps using the Delta V statistic (Delta V = 0.38). A coupled ocean- atmosphere general circulation model including sulfate aerosols was used to drive a double greenhouse gas scenario to the end of the next century. The simulated vegetation under changed climate with a CO:! concentration of 500 ppmv and a baseline biome map were also compared using the Delta V statistic (Delta V = 0.4). The climate change would cause a large reduction in the temperate deserts alpine steppe, desert, and ice/polar desert, a large increase in the cold-temperate conifer forest, temperate shrubland/meadow, and temperate steppe, and a general northwestward shift of ail vegetation zones. In addition to simulation of biome distribution, BIOME3China also predicted net primary production (NPP) of each grid cell. Comparisons between predicted annual NPP and 160 forest NPP measurements show an agreement between them with a linear regression, despite many problems, such as the quality of the field data. The pattern of predicted annual NPP in the scenario with enhanced CO2 concentration was the same as that under the present climate; however, the NPP of each biome would increase significantly. Present permafrost simulated using the air frost index was quite similar to the actual frozen ground distribution on the Tibetan Plateau. After the change in climate, the boundary between continuous and discontinuous permafrost would shift toward the north of the plateau by about 1-2 degrees in latitude.

Nutrients can be conserved mainly by extending the life span of plant parts and/or by minimizing the nutrient content of those parts that are abscissed. Together these two parameters (life span and resorption) define the mean residence time (MRT) of a nutrient. In this review we summarize available information on nitrogen resorption and life span, and evaluate their relationship to the MRT of nitrogen, both between and within species. Abundant information with respect to nitrogen resorption efficiency and life span is available at the leaf level. By definition, woody evergreen plants have a much longer leaf life span than species of other life-forms. Conversely, differences in resorption efficiency among life-forms or among plants in habitats differing in soil fertility appear to be small. Inter-specific variation in leaf life span is much larger than intra-specific variation (factor of >200 compared with 2, respectively), while resorption efficiency varies by about the same magnitude at both levels (factor of 3.8 compared with 2.7, respectively). The importance of resorption efficiency in determining leaf-level MRT increases exponentially towards and above the maximum resorption efficiency observed in nature. This effect is independent of leaf life span, which may explain the lack of life-form related differences in resorption efficiency. When scaling up from the leaf to the whole-plant level, fundamental differences in turnover rate among different plant organs must be considered. Woody species invest c. 50% of their net productivity into their low-turnover stems, while in herbaceous species the life span of stems is only slightly longer than that of leaves. As a result, nutrient turnover of woody (evergreen and deciduous) plants is generally lower than that of herbaceous species (herbs and graminoids) on a whole-plant basis. At the intra-specific level empirical data show that both biomass life span (i.e. the inverse of biomass loss rate) and resorption efficiency are important sources of variation in MRT. However, we argue that the relative importance of resorption efficiency in explaining variation in MRT is lower at the interspecific level, whereas the reverse is true for life span. This is because variation in MRT and life span is much larger at the inter-specific level compared with variation in resorption efficiency. Plant traits related to nutrient conservation are discussed with respect to their implications for leaf structure, plant growth, competition, succession and ecosystem nutrient cycling.",,,,"Eckstein, Lutz/A-9241-2012; Weih, Martin/H-5093-2011; Karlsson, Staffan/J-3082-2012","Weih, Martin/0000-0003-3823-9183; Karlsson, Staffan/0000-0002-5739-5213",,,,,,,,,,,,0028-646X,1469-8137,,,,JUL,1999,143,1,,,,,177,189,,10.1046/j.1469-8137.1999.00429.x,,,,,,,WOS:000081916300017,,,,,09/09/2020,470,empirical,plant nutrient concentrations,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Inferences of the gross taxonomic origin of sediment organic matter from lignin-phenol composition agree with vegetational reconstructions based on pollen assemblages. In particular, the ratios of syringyl to vanillyl phenols are consistently higher before 6500 yr BP, when angiosperms dominated or codominated the regional vegetation, than after 6500 yr BP, when gymnosperms dominated. However, the ratios of cinnamyl (p-coumaric and ferulic acids) to total vanillyl phenols (C/V) do not show patterns expected from the abundance of woody plants. C/V ratios are particularly high (0.7-0.85) after 6500 yr BP when pollen spectra suggest closed boreal forests dominated by Picea, and the stratigraphic patterns are strikingly similar between C/V and Picea pollen concentrations. CuO oxidation of modern pollen of P. glauca and P. mariana yields exceptionally high amounts of cinnamyl phenols (8.90 and 6.41 mg/100 mg OC for P. glauca and P. mariana, respectively). In particular, p-coumaric acid is obtained in large amounts (8.87 and 6.41 mg/100 mg OC for P. glauca and P. mariana, respectively) versus vanillyl phenols (0.25 and 0.49 mg/100 mg OC for P. glauca and P. mariana, respectively) and ferulic acid (0.03 and 0.00 mg/100 mg OC for P. glauca and P. mariana, respectively). Thus lignin phenols derived from fossil Picea pollen preserved in sediments likely drive the C/V profile of the Wien Lake core. These data imply that if Picea pollen concentrations are sufficiently high, the amount of nonwoody tissue in sediments may be grossly overestimated when the lignin composition of gymnosperm needles is used as the end member of nonwoody tissues. Given that pollen grains are among the most resistant components of sedimentary organic matter and that p-coumaric acid is labile, it is important to consider pollen as a nonwoody tissue type when lignin biomarkers are used to determine the sources of vascular-plant material in sediments.

LWD input from the floodplain is low: 669.6 mg year(-1) between 1948 and 1971 and 569.3 mg year(-1) between 1971 and 1991. Based on estimates of average LWD mass per study plot, a range of 766-2122 mg year(-1) of LWD were stored within the active channel (e.g., unvegetated bars and low-flow channel; 60 km course covering 492 ha). LWD accumulations are mainly observed on gravel bars at a limited number of preferential sites. They are relatively rare and are randomly distributed in the low-flow channel. Consequently, LWD location is mainly associated with the decrease of flow level in shallow sectors. In the low-flow channel, LWD stop-en-route is primarily caused by in-channel structures such as boulders or vegetated islets. General geomorphological factors (e.g., pattern, slope, etc.) provide less explanation of LWD distribution. Moreover, the residence time of LWD accumulations on the Drome River is short (LWD storage = 1.3-3.7 times the annual LWD input from the floodplain) and their morphogenic role is negligible: few of the accumulations are buried or characterized by vegetation shoots and associated pools.

The sites were upland sires, and the stands were 28-39 years old. We compared understory within three categories of microsite types: Red Alder-dominated, conifer-dominated, and mixed alder-conifer. Biomass of forbs and ferns differed significantly (P < 0.05) between microsite types, being greatest in alder microsites, least in conifer microsites, and intermediate in mixed alder-conifer microsites for all of the following: Circaea alpina, Galium triflorum, Tiarella trifoliata, Viola glabella, Athyrium flix-femina, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Thelypteris phegopteris, total forbs, total ferns, and total herbs. Shrub biomass also was greatest in alder microsites but was least in mixed microsites and intermediate in conifer microsites (P < 0.05 for Rubus spetabilis leaves and total shrub leaves). The greater shrub biomass in conifer than mixed microsites resulted from several large parches of poor tree regeneration within 7 of the 16 stands; the other 9 stands had very low understory biomass in their conifer microsites, which is consistent with published studies of understory dynamics in even-aged stands of the region. The results illustrate two important conclusions regarding current understanding of secondary succession following clearcutting in southeastern Alaska: (1) inclusion of Red Alder in the regenerating stand may result in much greater understory biomass than occurs in pure conifer stands; and (2) extrapolation of data from small, uniform, fully-stocked research stands to the landscape level may underestimate understory biomass from poorly stocked parches. Both conclusions have important implications for wildlife habitat in terms of understory vegetation for food and cover. The potential of Red Alder as a mitigating factor for wildlife habitat following clearcutting in the region needs additional study of disturbance-site-understory interactions. Our results, however, indicate that an understory-exclusionary stage of secondary succession is not necessarily the only successional pathway following clearcutting, in southeastern Alaska.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-3550,,,,,OCT-DEC,1998,112,4,,,,,647,652,,,,,,,,,WOS:000079733000008,,,,,09/09/2020,473,empirical,forest understorey composition,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Seed germination of all species increased with experimental warming, suggesting that the present treeline may in part result from unsuccessful recruitment under cold conditions. 2 Growth, biomass and survivorship of seedlings of treeline species transplanted into tundra were largely unaffected by experimental warming. However, transplanted seedlings of three species (Betula papyrifera, Picea glauca and Populus tremuloides) grew more when below-ground competition with the extant community was reduced. All three measures of transplant performance were greater in shrub tundra than in the less productive tussock or heath tundra. Establishment of trees in tundra may thus be prevented by low resource availability and competition. 3 Two species (Alnus crispa and Populus balsamifera) had low seed germination and survivorship of germinated seeds; transplants of these species did not respond to the manipulations and lost biomass following transplanting into tundra. Isolated populations of these two species north of the present treeline in arctic Alaska probably became established during mid-Holocene warming rather than in recent times. 4 Of all the species studied here, Picea glauca was the most likely to invade intact upland tundra. Its seeds had the highest germination rates and it was the only species whose seedlings survived subsequently.

The effects of these treatments on vegetation cover were assessed at the start of the 1991, 1993, and 1995 field seasons, and at peak biomass in the same years. Over the first season of the experiment (1991), changes in percentage total living vegetation cover were significantly greater, and changes in dead vegetation cover significantly lower, in the tented treatments. In subsequent seasons, changes in total living cover were also greater under treatments simulating climate change, although the significant factors and interactions were year-specific. Between years, at both the early and mid-season sampling periods, the fertilizer application had the strongest effect on changes in plant cover, significantly decreasing cover of living Dryas octopetala, Saxifraga oppositifolia, and bare ground between 1991 and 1995, while increasing cover of bryophytes, Salix polaris, Polygonum viviparum, and total dead vegetation. Although cover of D. octopetala was greater during the first three years of fertilizer addition, marked winter injury occurred in this species on fertilized plots during winter 1993-1994. This resulted in reductions in total live cover and D. octopetala cover and an increase in total dead cover (by up to 22%) in watered and fertilized plots between 1991 and 1995. Seedlings of nitrophilous immigrant species were established naturally on bare ground in fertilized plots in the third year of the study and subsequently increased in number, so that after five seasons the community tended more toward bird-cliff vegetation rather than polar semi-desert vegetation.

Colour preferences of avian frugivores, in the aviary and in the field, varied among individuals, but the majority favoured red fruits. Seed predators (mostly rodents) did not discriminate between seeds from different morphs. The effect of seed passage through the digestive tract of frugivores (birds and bears) on germination was similar for both morphs, although there were significant differences among frugivores. The type of soil on which the seeds are deposited influenced their germination behaviour, suggesting that some soils could favour one morph over the other. Such differences may contribute to the regional differences in frequencies of the two morphs.

The responses of the vegetation to the perturbations were then assessed by point intercept (quadrat) analysis followed by determination of above-ground biomass. 2 Nineteen vascular and 23 non-vascular species (or species groups) were recorded and the most dramatic response was that of the grass Calamagrostis lapponica to nutrient addition, with abundance being stimulated by a factor of more than 18 compared with plots not subjected to nutrient addition. Calamagrostis lapponica did not show any significant responses to temperature or water alone but there was a synergistic interaction between all three variables. 3 The abundance of the dominant dwarf shrubs (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, V. myrtillus and V. uliginosum) was unaffected by the perturbations but elevated temperature stimulated the biomass of V. uliginosum by 125% and total shrub biomass by 16%. The low ratio of current year's growth to standing biomass may have concealed other responses of the dwarf shrub group to the perturbations. 4 The response of the non-vascular flora to the perturbations was either neutral or negative, with lichens showing the most dramatic responses. Lichen biomass on temperature- and nutrient-amended plots was 56% and 18%, respectively, of that on unperturbed plots. Nutrients also exerted a negative effect on the biomass of bryophytes, and the combined biomass of lichens and bryophytes on nutrient-treated plots was almost a third of that on plots which did not receive additional nutrients. 5 Total above-ground biomass was not affected by the perturbations but the total number of interceptions determined by point quadrat analysis was greater on the elevated temperature and nutrient-treated plots. Point quadrat analysis also revealed an accumulation of litter and standing dead material in response to the nutrient and temperature perturbations, both singly and in combination, suggesting a faster turnover of plant material. 6 Both temperature and nutrients increased canopy height and also interacted synergistically such that together they resulted in a mean canopy height of 14.9 cm compared with 8.0 cm in plots subjected to neither perturbation. 7 Nutrient addition lowered species richness by 17.7%, mainly through its impact on the mosses and lichens. 8 In general, nutrient addition elicited the greatest response, followed by temperature, with water exerting little measurable influence. There were a number of important interactions that were often synergistic, and some involved water. 9 Species' responses were highly individualistic and changes in the community were mediated through the response of a small number of key species already present in the community, with no invasion of new species.

The model closely predicted the observed bite-size selection of moose, and further showed how differences in twig morphology, spatial density, and forage chemistry affect optimal bite diameter and energy gain per time unit.

Flowering began about 30 days earlier on equatorial-facing slopes. Flowering periods of individuals on slopes with the same aspect had a mean overlap of 0.52, while those on opposite slopes had a mean overlap of 0.15. On equatorial-facing slopes Yramea lathionoides (Lepidoptera) accounted for 60% of the visits to flowers of A. cumingii, while on polar-facing slopes Centris cineraria (Hymenoptera) was responsible for more than 80% of flower visits. Average similarities of visitor assemblages among individual plants on slopes with the same aspect was 0.83, while the mean similarity between individuals on opposite slopes was only 0.23. Within slopes fluorescent dyes were dispersed up to 40 m from the donor plants, but there was no movements of dyes between individuals growing on opposite slopes, even when they were separated by less than 10 m. Synchronous blooming and a common pollen vector are necessary conditions for pollen exchange between individuals. The overall probability of pollen exchange estimated by multiplying the inter-individual overlap for both factors, was nearly 0.5 for individuals growing on slopes with the same aspect, and less than 0.04 for individuals growing on opposite slopes. Consequently, at equivalent distances, the probability of pollen exchange between individuals growing on slopes of opposite aspect is more than 10-times lower than between those growing on the same slopes. Seed dispersal cannot compensate for restricted gene flow through pollination, because seeds of A. cumingii were dispersed less than 2 m away from a parent plant. Presumably, restricted gene flow could enhance genetic divergence between populations on slopes of contrasting aspects.

(3) Low forage production in the study area was due to a high proportion of outcrops (17%) and open black spruce stands (20%), and to the old age of most forest stands. (4) Forage had a patchy distribution: production of leaves in the most productive habitat type, deciduous stands, exceeded by 22 times that measured in the coniferous stands. Forage distribution influenced habitat use by moose, which generally showed year-round preferences for forage-rich mixed and deciduous stands and resulted in large home ranges. (5) Balsam fir dominated moose diets in late winter, whereas this plant species represented only 17-19% of forage consumed further south in the moose range. We hypothesized that heavy consumption of balsam iir negatively affected the energy balance of moose in winter. (6) Monitored females produced only 78 calves: 100 cows, during three consecutive years. This relatively low rate of calf production could be related to suboptimal nutrition in winter and in summer. We found a significant relationship between snow depth, summer temperature, and lactation rare, an index to cow:calf ratios in autumn. Lactation rate was more strongly related to weather of the preceding year than that of the current one, suggesting that weather had an immediate influence on body reserves of dams, but little impact on calf production until the next year. (7) Calves experienced high survival, particularly during their first summer of life (90%), in contrast with southern moose populations exposed to higher predation pressure. Annual survival of adult females (87%) exceeded that of males (74%) because the latter were more vulnerable to hunting. Natural mortality was similar in both sexes, 8-10%. In adults, predation may have been lighter, and other natural mortality causes higher in the study area than in the core of the moose range. (8) Limiting factors, i.e. climate, drowning, played a greater role in the demography of the study moose population than predation, the suspected regulating factor. Our data set illustrates that regulation may be difficult to detect in unproductive environments, a common situation at the periphery of any species distribution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0952-8369,1469-7998,,,,AUG,1997,242,,4,,,,765,781,,10.1111/j.1469-7998.1997.tb05825.x,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XR08300010,,,,,09/09/2020,482,empirical,moose regulation,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

We employed a PS-II (personal spectrometer II) portable field spectroradiometer to measure narrow-band spectra at nadir and the PARABOLA (portable apparatus for rapid acquisition of bidirectional observations of the land and atmosphere) three-channel radiometer to gather bidirectional radiometric data over almost the complete ground hemisphere. Measurements were taken at a lowland wet sedge site and at two tussock tundra sites containing different amounts of woody deciduous shrub cover. PS-II nadir measurements alone allowed spectral differentiation between the highly senescent wet sedge site and the two relatively greener tussock tundra sites but did not allow clear discrimination between tussock tundra sites. Off-nadir measurements, however, permitted good discrimination between the two tussock tundra sites. For example, the reflectance-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIrho) difference between the tussock tunda sites at a 75 degrees forward-scatter view angle averaged 26% over a range of solar zenith angles (Theta(s)s). Similarly, NDVI rho calculated from PARABOLA spectral hemispheric data averaged 6% higher in woody tussock tundra than in nonwoody tussock tundra. Differences between the tussock sites calculated by using NDVI based on hemispheric radiance (NDVIL) were greater than those calculated by using hemispheric NDVI rho by approximately a factor of two regardless of Theta(s). Measurements taken when Theta(s)=75 degrees generally exhibited the largest differences between NDVI at the two tussock tundra sites. Although nadir measurements exhibited minimal differences between tussock tundra types, bidirectional and hemispheric-based NDVI values revealed differences in tussock tundra woody vegetation cover because large view zenith angles were sensitive to the woody shrub foliage that extends above the hummocky tundra surface in early spring. These results may be useful for detecting changes in tundra woody cover through time.

Gas exchange and soil microenvironment measurements were made weekly between 14 June and 31 July 1990. The study communities included lichen-heath, a sparse community vegetated by lichens and dwarf ericaceous shrubs on rocky soils, moist Cassiope dwarf-shrub heath tundra, dominated by Carex and evergreen and deciduous shrubs on relatively deep organic soils, and dry Cassiope dwarf-shrub heath of stone-stripe areas, which was of intermediate character. Rates of CO2 efflux were similar for the three communities until mid-season when they peaked at rates between 4.9 and 5.9 g m(-2) d(-1). Following the midseason peak, the rates in all three communities declined, particularly in the lichen-heath. Seasonal patterns of CO2 efflux, soil temperature, and soil moisture suggest changing limitations to CO2 efflux over the course of the season. Rates of carbon dioxide efflux followed changes in soil temperature early in the season when soil moisture was highest. Mid-season efflux appeared to be limited by soil, moss, and lichen hydration until the end of July, when temperature again limited efflux. Differences between the communities were related to microenvironmental differences and probable differences in carbon quality. The presence of peat-forming mosses is suggested to play an important role in differences in efflux and microenvironment among the communities.",,,,"Cheng, Weixin/F-4968-2011","Cheng, Weixin/0000-0003-2964-2376",,,,,,,,,,,,0004-0851,,,,,AUG,1996,28,3,,,,,328,338,,10.2307/1552112,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VE60500010,,,,,09/09/2020,487,empirical,carbon fluxes,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

In contrast, the warmer, drier 1993 field season flux measurements were -0.02, 42.9 and 407 mg CH4/m(2)/d. The data indicate that despite net oxidation of CH4 in the dry regions of the bog, the wetland is a net source of CH4, with fluxes ranging across three orders of magnitude between different plant communities. Comparison with water levels suggests that CH4 flux is turned on and off by changes in site hydrology. In sites where sufficient moisture is present for methanogenesis to occur, CH4 flux appears to be temperature limited, responding exponentially to soil temperature changes. The combined effects of hydrology and temperature create hot spots of CH4 flux within boreal wetlands.

Warming enhanced the green biomass (equivalent to the last 3-4 years of leaf production) and the ratio of green to brown biomass of C. tetragona at the fellfield, and diluted the shoot N concentration. Fertilizer application led to higher shoot N concentration and larger green-to-brown biomass ratio at both sites, and fertilizer application and warming generally had an additive effect on the green biomass. We conclude that both warming and increased soil nutrient availability stimulated the growth of C. tetragona at the fellfield whereas at the heath there was a clear increase in production only if enhanced temperature was combined with nutrient application. Across treatments C. tetragona at the fellfield had 0.6 parts per thousand higher delta(13)C and 1.4 mg g(-1) more leaf N, and the soil organic matter delta(13)C was 1.0 parts per thousand higher at the fellfield than at the heath. However, an increase in shoot N concentration with altitude does not necessarily lead to higher delta(13)C as no differences in delta(13)C were observed when leaf N of the two dwarf shrubs was increased by fertilizer application C. tetragona in non-warmed plots had higher delta(13)C values than those from warmed plots at the same altitude, which provides the first in situ experimental validation of the theory that temperature partly is responsible for altitudinal trends in plant carbon isotope discrimination. Increased biomass and chlorophyll concentration of C. tetragona in warmed plots points to increased assimilation, at least at the fellfield. As the delta(13)C-based and, therefore, time-integrated estimate of the ratio of CO, concentration in the leaf intercellular spaces to that in the atmosphere (C-i/C-a) also increased, warming probably enhanced the stomatal conductance relatively more than the C assimilation, which may be harmful if climatic change leads to reduced soil moisture content and increased plant competition for water. At both sites C. tetragona and E. hermaphroditum responded to shade by increasing the concentration of shoot N and photosynthetic pigments whereas biomass production (and therefore also net photosynthesis) did not decline. Shade was accompanied by a 0.6-1.3 parts per thousand (E. hermaphroditum) or 1.2-2.2 parts per thousand (C. tetragona) decrease in delta(13)C. This could be due to enhanced stomatal conductance with shading, and perhaps to shade reducing the ericoid mycorrhizal uptake of soil organic C, a factor which has been overlooked as an influence on plant delta(13)C.",,,,"Michelsen, Anders/L-5279-2014; Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014","Michelsen, Anders/0000-0002-9541-8658; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,JAN,1996,105,1,,,,,1,12,,10.1007/BF00328785,,,,,,,WOS:A1996TR65400001,28307116,,,,09/09/2020,489,empirical,shrub performance,biomass; chemical composition; physiology,"Abisko, SE",68.35,18.817,factorial experiment,temperature; fertilisation; shading,abiotic,Cassiope tetragona; Empetrum nigrum,2,species,,WOS search

The year of initiation of supranival stem growth (i.e. when stems first developed above the snowpack) was determined for trees, whorled growth forms and dead shrubs. Supranival tree stems developed synchronously in the valleys, from the late 1800s to the mid 1900s, in the area presently occupied by treeline trees, indicating that only krummholz (shrubby spruces) were present at these sites during the Little Ice Age. 3 A corresponding displacement of the treeline of about 12 km towards Hudson Bay has occurred in the area since the late 1800s, most likely as a result of recent warming. The recent treeline shift also resulted from the development of vertical tree stems from pre-established krummholz, suggesting that stem growth was a direct response to favourable summer growth conditions and reduced wind-driven snow abrasion and supercold wind-chill.

The floristic patterns and their relationships to methane (CH4) emission, hydrology and water chemistry were analysed with classification (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). 2 Despite differences in vegetation physiognomy, chemistry, and geology, water chemistry (pH, Ca, Mg, K-corr) and hydrology explain most of the species distribution in both peatland regions. In the Clay Belt, bryophytes respond primarily to water table position, and secondarily to water chemistry; the reverse is true for the vascular flora. The bryophyte and vascular ordinations are more similar to each other in the Labrador Trough than in boreal sites. 3 Although CH4 emissions are lower in subarctic than in boreal sites, mean CH4 flux is strongly correlated with mean water table position (r(2) = 0.73) in both regions, but is not correlated with water chemistry. The highest CH4 emissions (seasonal mean greater than or equal to 100 mg m(-2) day(-1)) occur in raised bog and patterned poor fen pools where the peat mat is degrading. 4 The relationships among CH4 flux, mean water table position, and species distribution are similar in both boreal and subarctic regions. Bryophytes are generally better predictors of CH4 flux than vascular plants, except for certain species in flooded sites (e.g. Carer spp.). Bryophytes are also better indicators of the long-term average position of the water table, reflecting relative zones of methane production and oxidation over the season. In the vascular plant analyses, shrub cover indicates dry conditions and low CH4 flux in the sharply differentiated string-flark-pool topography of the subarctic fens, but is less predictive of CH4 emission in the drier hummock-hollow microtopography at boreal sites where shrubs and trees are more pervasive.

The measurements covered both natural, unmanipulated plots as well as plots from which ramets of one of five dwarf shrub species had been removed. 2 Annual patterns of growth and reproduction of ramets of the three species were different, suggesting that the plants were affected by different combinations of environmental factors and internal patterns of ramet growth. Neither cumulative summer temperature nor summer precipitation accounted for the variations in annual growth of any dwarf shrub species; however, ramet age contributed significantly to the observed variation in growth of shoots of V. vitis-idaea and V. uliginosum. 3 The growth of ramets of E. nigrum in unmanipulated plots was positively correlated with the cover of V. myrtillus and total cover of dwarf shrubs; the growth of V. uliginosum was similarly correlated with the cover of V, myrtillus in undisturbed plots. Furthermore, the growth of both E. nigrum and V. uliginosum was reduced by the removal of V. uliginosum and V. myrtillus, respectively. These observations probably indicate some kind of positive relationship between these species. By contrast, the shoot growth of V. vitis-idaea was less and mortality greater in unmanipulated plots where V. uliginosum was abundant, while both branching and reproduction of V. vitis-idaea were increased by the removal of other dwarf shrubs.

In this paper we review developmental aspects of the ray system and suggest a general hypothesis for the regulation of ray differentiation and evolution, In studies of ray differentiation, two basic factors should be taken into consideration: 1) the normal gradual increase in ray size in relation to age, distance from the pith, and distance from the young leaves; and 2) the influence of wound effects on the size, structure, and spacing of rays. The relationships between the rate of cambial activity and secondary xylem differentiation are not clearly understood. There are contrasting results on the relationships between ray number and rate of radial growth. The rate of radial growth (= rate of cambial activity) is not the regulating mechanism of ray characteristics. Bunning (1952, 1965) proposed that rays are distributed regularly in the tissue, as the outcome of an inhibitory influence expressed by them. However, Bunning's hypothesis contradicts a basic feature of the vascular ray system, namely, fusion of rays. Detailed histological studies of the secondary xylem revealed that proximity to and contact with rays plays a major role in the survival of fusiform initials in the cambium (Bannan, 1951, 1953). Such evidence led Ziegler (1964) to suggest that since the cambium is supplied predominantly via the rays, this is an effective feedback regulative system for an equidistant arrangement of the rays. The hypothesis that rays are induced and controlled by a radial signal flow seems to be the best explanation for the structure and spacing of rays. The formation of a polycentric ray-a special case of ''ray'' initiation inside a vascular ray-supports the idea that radial signal flow occurs within the rays (Lev-Yadun and Aloni, 1991a). This idea is also supported by findings from Quercus species in which aggregate rays in the xylem disperse naturally in branch junctions and, following partial girdling, leave a longitudinal narrow bridge of cambium and bark as a result of enhanced axial signal flow (of auxin and other growth regulators) (Lev-Yadun and Aloni, 1991b). The longitudinally elongated shape of rays is their response to axial signal flows (mainly the polar auxin flow). Two methods have been used to study the evolution of the ray system: 1) statistical studies of the relationships between vessel and ray characteristics in many species, when vessel characteristics were the evolutionary standard, and 2) comparison of ray characteristics in fossils originating from several geological eras. We suggest that evolution of the ray system reflects changes in the relations between radial and axial signal flows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8101,1874-9372,,,,JAN-MAR,1995,61,1,,,,,45,84,,10.1007/BF02897151,,,,,,,WOS:A1995RL24300003,,,,,09/09/2020,493,review,woody plant anatomy,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Thin siltcaps (< 0.25 m) had vegetation dominated by herbaceous species, whereas thicker siltcaps had a strong component of shrubs. The depth of the siltcap accounted for about 50% of the variation in the first principle-component of the variation in species composition and cover. In situ net N mineralization increased with increasing siltcap depth, but net nitrification declined. Production by herbs increased by about 20% with water additions but not with N additions, and the responses were strongest at the two intermediate siltcap depths. Shrub production increased by about 30% with N addition but not with water additions, with stronger responses on thicker siltcaps.

Predation by the grey wolf (Canis lupus) and by bears (Ursus arctos and U. americanus) is considered. Moose densities in North America are generally below 0.5 animals km(-2). In most areas, density-dependent food exploitation seems to operate at densities greater than 1.0 moose km(-2) Results from 27 studies were used to assess the functional and numerical responses of wolves to changing moose density. Per capita killing rate and wolf density were related (P = 0.01) to moose density following a Type II response. Wolf predation rate proved to be density dependent from 0 to 0.65 moose km(-2), and inversely density dependent at higher moose densities. An empirical model based on these results suggests that moose would stabilise at high densities in the absence of predators (FOOD model) or in the presence of wolves only (PREDATION-FOOD one-state model). If moose productivity level is diminished through deteriorating habitat quality, or if bear predation is added, then a low-density equilibrium (0.2-0.4 moose km(-2)) is predicted (PREDATION model). The demography of the George River caribou herd in northern Quebec/Labrador is reviewed for the period 1955-93. The herd increased from 5000 animals in 1955 to 644 000 (c. 1.5 animals km(-2)) in 1984, following an exponential growth rate (r) of 0.16. The herd reached a plateau of c. 725 000 animals in early 1990. A decline is predicted for the near future because of severe habitat degradation. In the 1980s, nutritional stress has been documented, especially in summer when caribou used traditional ranges depleted of key forage resources such as lichens and tundra shrubs. Food competition is viewed as the dominant regulatory factor (FOOD model), although the nature of caribou-habitat interactions may generate longterm fluctuations in numbers because of a time-delay effect. Wolf predation does not appear to be an important mortality factor capable of regulating the George River herd. The above case studies can be interpreted within the context of the 'food chain dynamics' theory. For the non-migrant ungulate (moose), a three-link system is proposed where predators hold down grazers, which in turn use only a small fraction of annual forage production. For the migrant ungulate (caribou), a two-link system is proposed where high-density grazers exert a strong regulatory control on plant productivity and where predators have minimal effect on grazers.",,,,"Michel-Hernandez, Misael Angel/N-2073-2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,1035-3712,,,,,,1995,22,1,,,,,131,146,,10.1071/WR9950131,,,,,,,WOS:A1995RE80600013,,,,,09/09/2020,495,empirical,predator-prey dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

These data suggest, that under current climate change scenarios, increases in CO2, temperature and nutrient availability would promote growth in a qualitatively similar way. The evidence suggests that both tiller size and daughter tiller production will increase, and be shifted towards production of phalanx tillers which have a greater propensity for flowering. Furthermore, age at tillering as well as tiller life span may decrease, whereas survival of younger age classes might be higher. Mathematical models using experimental data incorporating these hypotheses were used to a) integrate the various responses and to calculate the order of magnitude of changes in population growth rate (lambda), and b) to explore the implications of responses in individual demographic parameters for population growth rate. The models suggest that population growth rate following climate change might increase significantly, but not unrealistically so, with the younger, larger, guerilla tillers being the most important tiller categories contributing to lambda.

We examined factors controlling the distribution of steppe taxa on an elevation gradient across a steppe tundra ecotone; such analyses may help define potential Full-Glacial distributions of these taxa. Multivariate analyses suggest that species can be divided into four spatially distinct groups, but individualistic species distributions create considerable overlap among these groups. The steppe-tundra ecotone comprises a broad zone of mixing between steppe taxa and drought-tolerant alpine tundra taxa, followed by an abrupt shift to alpine shrub tundra. The transition from low steppe to tundra vegetation is primarily associated with a gradient of decreasing soil temperature. The more abrupt transition from mixed steppe-tundra to alpine shrub tundra vegetation is primarily associated with changes in soil depth and soil moisture. Variation in vegetation within steppe is associated with gradients in soil phosphorus and moisture. Greenhouse experiments on drought tolerance of two steppe and two tundra taxa suggest that the individualistic distribution of species along the ecotone is partly a function of physiological differences among species.

Auxins generally promote rooting in herbaceous cuttings and are often considered to limit rooting, but they often have little or no effect when applied to difficult-to-root woody cuttings. They can move in a polar (basipetal) pathway but the polarity of root emergence equally reflects the activity of the vascular system in general, including the phloem, whose contents have a complex composition. The interactions between a morphogen of vascular origin and potential sites for root initiation are likely to be dynamic and variables such as flux rate or flux direction could be more relevant than static variables such as composition or concentration. The potential sites are not equally sensitive to the rooting morphogen since each cell has a unique lineage, ontogeny and position, and a prevailing insensitivity could restrict rooting. The contents of the vascular system are inaccessible to potential sites in the stem, so factors affecting efflux and the subsequent attenuation of the efflux, which depend on activity in the whole cutting, could be critical to rooting ability. No simply defined morphogen can be said to limit rooting, and the chemical identity of the morphogen (if definable) is probably unimportant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1462-0316,2380-4084,,,,JUL,1994,69,4,,,,,591,600,,10.1080/14620316.1994.11516491,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NZ58700002,,,,,09/09/2020,499,review,woody plant anatomy,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil transfers from the two successional stages were hypothesized to have different effects on plant species that colonize disturbed sites at different times or on different substrates. The site consisted of coarse, dry, low-nutrient spoils and was naturally colonized by scattered P. balsamifera but not A. crispa, although seed sources for both were adjacent to the site. Physical dimensions of the transplanted seedlings and cuttings were measured at the beginning and end of each growing season. Selected plants were harvested at the end of the 2-year study and examined for mycorrhizal formation, current growth, and leaf tissue nutrient concentrations. Both plant species were taller when treated with the soil transfers from the mature forest than with soils from the intermediate site although the increase for A. crispa was greater. Physical dimensions, current growth, and nutrient concentrations were greater when A. crispa was treated with the mature soil transfer compared with the intermediate soil transfer. Mycorrhizae which infected Alnus were predominantly a brown woody type, while other types accounted for greater relative mycorrhizal infection percentage on Populus.

The populations were selected to represent different parts of the range of the species, one growing in a high arctic coastal heath at Ny-Alesund (Svalbard, northern part of the species' range), one at a subarctic fellfield at 1150 m a.s.l. at Abisko, Swedish Lapland, and one in a subarctic tree-line heath at 450 m a.s.l. at Abisko, southern part of the species' range. The manipulations included nutrient addition, shading and two levels of temperature enhancement using passive greenhouses. The micrometeorological effects of the shading treatment was similar to that of a mountain birch canopy and the temperature enhancement treatments had the desired effect to increase the average air temperature by 2-4-degrees-C. Greenhouses which had a gap between the soil and the greenhouse plastic were particularly successful in creating the desired climatic perturbation without causing extreme maximum temperatures or other unwanted side-effects. The environmental manipulations caused strikingly different responses in the vegetative growth pattern of main shoots of C. tetragona among the three populations: at the subarctic tree-line heath, nutrient addition caused a substantial increase in growth, whereas it was the temperature enhancement treatments that caused increases, although smaller, at the subarctic fellfield and the high arctic heath sites. At the high arctic site, we also found growth reduced in response to shading, but at the subarctic sites, and particularly at the tree-line heath site, shading caused a marked etiolation of the shoots. Hence, different factors seem to produce very different responses in the vegetative growth of C. tetragona in different parts of its geographical range. We conclude that competition for nutrients and light are the main limiting factors for the growth of Cassiope tetragona near the lower distributional limit (LODIL) of the species, but that temperature is the main limiting factor in the northern parts of its range, and at high altitudes in the southern parts of its range. We also suggest that the direct effect of predicted future climatic warming on the growth of Cassiope tetragona will increase towards the north, whereas a possible indirect effect of increasing nutrient availability following a temperature increase will be the main effect in the southern and lower parts of its range. These responses could, however, be modified by shading from other species responding to environmental change by increased growth.",,,,"Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,APR,1993,66,3,,,,,389,402,,10.2307/3544933,,,,,,,WOS:A1993KZ32600003,,,,,09/09/2020,502,empirical,shrub growth,growth,"Abisko, SE; Svalbard, NO",78.933,11.833,factorial experiment,temperature; fertilisation; shading,abiotic,Cassiope tetragona,1,species,,WOS search

Stomatal density is an important physiological parameter that underpins the productivity of terrestrial vegetation by affecting both rate of carbon uptake and water use efficiency. Previous work on temperate tree species showed a decrease in stomatal density in response to a 60 p.p.m.v. increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration over the past 200 years. However, such a short timespan largely excludes the genetic component of plant adaptation to change in CO2 concentration. We present the first record of stomatal density from fossil leaves extending over 140 ka. Our record for the arctic-alpine dwarf shrub Salix herbacea L. extends back to the penultimate glacial stage, spanning two intervals when atmospheric CO2 concentration was considerably lower (by ca. 170 p.p.m.v.) than at present. Our results demonstrate a decrease in stomatal density in response to long-term increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration, and are in accordance with previous short-term observations and experiments. This implies that relaxation of the stress imposed by low atmospheric CO2 concentration has enabled terrestrial plants to exhibit an adaptive response to the other limiting factor of water availability by reducing stomatal density and hence improving water use efficiency.",,,,"Beerling, David/C-2840-2009","Beerling, David/0000-0003-1869-4314",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,FEB 22,1993,251,1331,,,,,133,138,,10.1098/rspb.1993.0019,,,,,,,WOS:A1993KP33400008,,,,,09/09/2020,503,empirical,paleoclimate,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Some roots were sampled from species which occurred on both disturbed and stable soils. Root length, root angle, numbers of roots and root diameter varied greatly between species but the degree of branching of roots was generally low. Among all species, and particularly forbs and graminoids which are the most common life forms on polygons, there was a clear trend of decreasing root diameter with increasing soil disturbance, while the species growing on both disturbed and stable ground showed no clear trend associated with soil disturbance. The small root diameter of species growing on the polygons could result from the different species and life forms found there together with a younger age class distribution of plants, younger plants having smaller roots. Only one third of the species growing on the most disturbed soils had rhizomes, whereas twice as many species possessed rhizomes in areas of lower disturbance. The tensile strength, breaking strain (a measure of how much a root is deformed by stretching), breaking stress (a measure of root strength corrected for the cross-sectional area) and the resilience (a measure of the elastic recovery of stretched roots) of the roots varied highly significantly among the species. The tensile strength varied 6.5-fold, the breaking strain varied by up to almost 8-fold and the breaking stress 13-fold. The modulus of resilience varied least, by a factor of only two. There was no clear trend in the way mechanical properties of the roots of the three species occurring on both stable and frost-heaved soils varied between the two regimes. However, among all species, those from the frost-heaved soils tended to have the weakest roots, because of their small diameter, but the strongest roots per cross-sectional area (i.e. they had the greatest breaking stress). Among life-forms, graminoids tolerated a significantly greater strain than forbs and dwarf shrubs and much higher stress before they broke. Dwarf shrubs and forbs had significantly higher resilience than graminoids and the highest tensile strengths. Forbs showed the lowest values for all of the measured variables except for resilience, which fell between the values for graminoids and dwarf shrubs. There were no significant differences in any of the mechanical measures of root resistance among species of different frost-heaving regimes, indicating that there are few architectural or mechanical properties which enable roots to survive in the most disturbed soil. Indeed, the absence of a complete plant canopy and an increase in abundance of young plants on the polygon area compared with the stable areas suggest that if there are any adaptations to strong disturbance, they are less than adequate and the hypothesis that arctic plants avoid, rather than adapt, to severe environment is supported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-646X,1469-8137,,,,SEP,1992,122,1,,,,,179,186,,10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb00064.x,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JQ91900017,,,,,09/09/2020,504,empirical,root traits,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

Unique adaptations to the Arctic have rarely been found. The recent influx of other species has, however, broken down reproductive barriers and gene flow has been stimulated. In extreme arctic environments, selection forces driving evolution are mainly of the physical environment and plant interactions are positive. Elsewhere, biotic factors, such as herbivory, are important and plant interactions become negative through competition. Physical selective forces operate in winter and summer. Low winter temperatures rarely affect arctic plants, but snow depth and duration influence species distributions. Deep and persistent snow deforms plants and limits the period of resource acquisition. Cryptogams are common in such snow beds. Little or no snow cover exposes plants to abrasion by wind-blow particles and desiccation. In such fell-field sites, deciduous species and xerophytes, such as evergreen cushion plants, are common. Arctic summers are short and developmental processes are extended beyond one growing season, with perennials predominating. Cushion plants efficiently increase their temperatures above ambient, while evergreen and deciduous ericaceous dwarf shrubs coexist and have complementary strategies for intercepting radiation in a low canopy. Tundra soils are generally infertile and may be disturbed by freeze/thaw cycles. Nutrients are conserved by recycling within shoots and between ramets within clones. Vegetative proliferation enhances the survival of young ramets, while physiological integration between ramets enables young ramets to forage across patchy environments. Negative plant-animal relationships are particularly important in the Subarctic. Periodic infestations of moth caterpillars defoliate large areas of mountain birch and stimulate increases in populations of their predators. Periodic population peaks of small rodents graze or kill much vegetation and they may moderate the dynamic structure of plant communities, as the plant species have different abilities to regenerate.",,,,"Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-0843,1923-1245,,,,JUN,1991,44,2,,,,,95,105,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991FV29700002,,,,,09/09/2020,505,review,plant life-history strategies,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS search

The objectives of this study were to determine the stable C-13 and O-18 isotopic composition of CaCO3 along a plant primary successional sequence (250 yr.) and to examine possible mechanisms controlling the formation of CaCO3 in these floodplain soils. Soil samples were analyzed from duplicate plots of three successional stages: open shrub (Stage III, 4 yr. old), young balsam poplar-alder (Stage V, 30 yr. old), and mature white spruce (Stage VIII, 170-250 yr. old). The early stages of plant succession showed little variation in the mean soil delta-C-13-PDB (-4.3 to -4.0 parts per thousand), while the Stage-VIII sites showed the greatest carbon depletion (delta-C-13-PDB = -7.9 to -6.2 parts per thousand). The mean soil delta-O-18-PDB-values ranged from -16.3 to -14.6 parts per thousand. These low delta-O-18-values reflect, in part, the very depleted meteoric precipitation (delta-O-18-PDB = -50.3 parts per thousand) for this cold, continental site. A few surface salt crust samples showed significant enrichment in both C and O isotopes. Six calcite-bearing rock samples from the Alaska Range, the source of the alluvial parent material, fell into two classes with means for delta-C-13-PDB of -0.2 and -5.2 parts per thousand and means for delta-O-18-PDB of -14.6 and -18.7 parts per thousand, respectively. The early Stage-III profiles showed little variation in isotopic composition with soil depth, suggesting that the CaCO3 was primarily inherited with the alluvial material and was not formed in situ. Surface evaporation of water played a minor role and transpirational loss of water played a major role in altering the isotopic composition of soil CaCO3 along the successional sequence. There was no evidence supporting freezing as a mechanism controlling soil CaCO3 precipitation.

Location Adventdalen, Spitsbergen, Svalbard (78 degrees 10 ' N, 16 degrees 04 ' E). Methods We manipulated snow depth on the tundra using fences, resulting in Deep, Medium, and Ambient snow regimes. Increased snow led to warmer winter soil temperatures, a delayed onset of growing season and wetter conditions during the early growing season. Plant community composition of living and dead plant material was recorded after nine years. NDVI was measured at the plot level using a handheld sensor. Results Community composition and the abundance of typically dominant shrub species were substantially different in the Deep compared to the Ambient regime. Deep had lower cover of live shrubs (Cassiope tetragona, Dryas octopetala and Salix polaris) and Luzula confusa, and higher cover of dead shrubs (Cassiope and Dryas) compared to the other snow regimes. Bryophyte cover was highest in Medium. NDVI was positively correlated to the cover of living vascular plants and negatively correlated to cover of dead vascular plants. Accordingly, Deep snow regime had reduced NDVI, reflecting the contribution of dead Cassiope and Dryas.

Biotic interactions are important in determining ecosystem response to such changes, but few studies have been long-term in nature, especially in the High Arctic. Mesic tundra plots on Svalbard, Norway, were subjected to grazing at two different intensities by captive Barnacle geese from 2003-2005, in a factorial design with warming by Open Top Chambers. Warming manipulations were continued through 2014, when we measured vegetation structure and composition as well as growth and reproduction of three dominant species in the mesic meadow. Significantly more dead vascular plant material was found in warmed compared to ambient plots, regardless of grazing history, but in contrast to many short-term experiments no difference in the amount of living material was found. This has strong implications for nutrient and carbon cycling and could feed back into community productivity. Dominant species showed increased flowering in warmed plots, especially in those plots where grazing had been applied. However, this added sexual reproduction did not translate to substantial shifts in vegetative cover. Forbs and rushes increased slightly in warmed plots regardless of grazing, while the dominant shrub, Salix polaris, generally declined with effects dependent on grazing, and the evergreen shrub Dryas octopetala declined with previous intensive grazing. There were no treatment effects on community diversity or evenness. Thus despite no changes in total live abundance, a typical short-term response to environmental conditions, we found pronounced changes in dead biomass indicating that tundra ecosystem processes respond to medium-to long-term changes in conditions caused by 12 seasons of summer warming. We suggest that while high arctic tundra plant communities are fairly resistant to current levels of climate warming, underlying ecosystem processes are beginning to change. In addition, even short bouts of intense herbivory can have long-term consequences for some species in these communities.",,,,"Alatalo, Juha/C-1269-2018; Little, Chelsea J./H-8676-2019","Alatalo, Juha/0000-0001-5084-850X; Little, Chelsea J./0000-0003-2803-7465",,,,,,,,,,,,1748-9326,,,,,FEB,2017,12,2,,,,,,,25001,10.1088/1748-9326/aa579d,,,,,,,WOS:000395418600001,,,,,24/09/2020,509,empirical,community structure,cover; phenology; reproduction,"Svalbard, NO",78.19,15.93,factorial experiment,temperature; herbivory,biotic; abiotic,Salix polaris; Dryas octopetala,2,species,,own record

We experimentally tested the effects of winter snow depth on shrub growth and ecophysiology by measuring stem length and stem hydrogen (delta H-2), carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotopic composition of the circumarctic evergreen dwarf shrub Cassiope tetragona growing in high-arctic Svalbard, Norway. Measurements were carried out on C. tetragona individuals sampled from three tundra sites, each representing a distinct moisture regime (dry heath, meadow, moist meadow). Individuals were sampled along gradients of experimentally manipulated winter snow depths in a six-year old snow fence experiment: in ambient (c. 20 cm), medium (c. 100 cm), and deep snow (c. 150 cm) plots. The deep-snow treatment consistently and significantly increased C. tetragona growth during the 2008-2011 manipulation period compared to growth in ambient-snow plots. Stem delta N-15 and stem N concentration values were significantly higher in deep-snow individuals compared to individuals growing in ambient-snow plots during the course of the experiment, suggesting that soil N-availability was increased in deep-snow plots as a result of increased soil winter N mineralization. Although interannual growing season-precipitation delta H-2 and stem delta H-2 records closely matched, snow depth did not change stem delta H-2 or delta O-18, suggesting that water source usage by C. tetragona was unaltered. Instead, the deep insulating snowpack may have protected C. tetragona shrubs against frost damage, potentially compensating the detrimental effects of a shortened growing season and associated phenological delay on growth.

We recorded seasonal shoot length, number of leaves, and capsules per shoot for three summers (2005-2007): two prior and one after the treatment began. Phenological events were recorded in 2007. The number of seeds per capsule was counted and seed germination was tested. Phenological development was significantly delayed behind fences, with lower shoot length, number of leaves, capsules, and seeds per shoot segment (16, 20, 54 and 11%, respectively) compared to controls, but there was no difference in these parameters between plots prior to fence establishment.

These changes have been predicted to cause afforestation or shrubification of open tundra, increases of warmth-demanding southern species and plant groups favoured by increased moisture, and decline of species and habitats that are dependent on snow cover. In this study, we explore temporal changes in northern tundra upland plant communities along regional gradients and in local habitats. We ask how vegetation changes are linked with long-term trends in regional climate and grazing pressure. LocationNorthern Europe. MethodsIn 2013-2014, we resurveyed a total of 108 vegetation plots on wind-exposed and snow-protected tundra habitats in three subareas along a bioclimatic gradient from the northern boreal to the arctic zone. Vegetation plots were originally sampled in 1964-1967. We related observed vegetation changes to changes in temperature, precipitation and grazing pressure, which all showed regionally variable increases over the study period. ResultsWe found a significant increase of the evergreen dwarf shrub Empetrum nigrum subsp. hermaphroditum in snow-protected communities and a prominent decrease of lichens throughout the study area. No evidence for extensive tree or larger shrub (Betula spp., Salix spp. or Juniperus communis) encroachment despite climatic warming trends was found. Among studied communities, most pronounced changes in vegetation were observed in snow-protected boreal heaths on small isolated uplands, where community composition showed low resemblance to the original composition described decades ago. Changes in plant communities correlated with changes in summer and winter temperatures, summer precipitation and reindeer grazing pressure, yet correlations varied depending on region and habitat.

We analyzed annual ring growth for an abundant and nearly circumpolar erect willow (Salix lanata L.) from the coastal zone of the northwest Russian Arctic (Nenets Autonomous Okrug). The resulting chronology is strongly related to summer temperature for the period 1942-2005. Remarkably high correlations occur at long distances (> 1600 km) across the tundra and taiga zones of West Siberia and Eastern Europe. We also found a clear relationship with photosynthetic activity for upland vegetation at a regional scale for the period 1981-2005, confirming a parallel 'greening' trend reported for similarly warming North American portions of the tundra biome. The standardized growth curve suggests a significant increase in shrub willow growth over the last six decades. These findings are in line with field and remote sensing studies that have assigned a strong shrub component to the reported greening signal since the early 1980s. Furthermore, the growth trend agrees with qualitative observations by nomadic Nenets reindeer herders of recent increases in willow size in the region. The quality of the chronology as a climate proxy is exceptional.

Compound disturbances by insect herbivores can cause sharp transitions between vegetation states with implications for ecosystem productivity and climate feedbacks. By analysing vegetation plots prior to and immediately after a severe and widespread outbreak by geometrid moths in the birch forest-tundra ecotone, we document a shift in forest understorey community composition in response to the moth outbreak. Prior to the moth outbreak, the plots divided into two oligotrophic and one eutrophic plant community. The moth outbreak caused a vegetation state shift in the two oligotrophic communities, but only minor changes in the eutrophic community. In the spatially most widespread communities, oligotrophic dwarf shrub birch forest, dominance by the allelopathic dwarf shrub Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, was effectively broken and replaced by a community dominated by the graminoid Avenella flexuosa, in a manner qualitatively similar to the effect of wild fires in E. nigrum communities in coniferous boreal forest further south. As dominance by E. nigrum is associated with retrogressive succession the observed vegetation state shift has widespread implications for ecosystem productivity on a regional scale. Our findings reveal that the impact of moth outbreaks on the northern boreal birch forest system is highly initial-state dependent, and that the widespread oligotrophic communities have a low resistance to such disturbances.

One of the most palpable effects of warming in Arctic ecosystems is shrub expansion above the tree line. However, previous studies have found that reindeer can influence plant community responses to warming and inhibit shrubification of the tundra. 2. We revisited grazed (ambient) and ungrazed study plots (exclosures), at the southern as well as the northern limits of the Swedish alpine region, to study long-term grazing effects and vegetation changes in response to increasing temperatures between 1995 and 2011, in two vegetation types (shrub heath and mountain birch forest). 3. In the field layer at the shrub heath sites, evergreen dwarf shrubs had increased in cover from 26% to 49% but were unaffected by grazing. Deciduous dwarf and tall shrubs also showed significant, though smaller, increases over time. At the birch forest sites, the increase was similar for evergreen dwarf shrubs (20-48%) but deciduous tall shrubs did not show the same consistent increase over time as in the shrub heath. 4. The cover and height of the shrub layer were significantly greater in exclosures at the shrub heath sites, but no significant treatment effects were found on species richness or diversity. 5. July soil temperatures and growing season thawing degree days (TDD) were higher in exclosures at all but one site, and there was a significant negative correlation between mean shrub layer height and soil TDD at the shrub heath sites. 6. Synthesis. This study shows that shrub expansion is occurring rapidly in the Scandes mountain range, both above and below the tree line. Tall, deciduous shrubs had benefitted significantly from grazing exclosure, both in terms of cover and height, which in turn lowered summer soil temperatures. However, the overriding vegetation shift across our sites was the striking increase in evergreen dwarf shrubs, which were not influenced by grazing.

For instance, relatively fast-growing, deciduous shrub species that are the most responsive to warming may also be the most targeted by herbivores such as reindeer, giving less palatable evergreen shrubs the chance to expand. Using herbivore exclosures, we have studied how two grasslands with contrasting nutrient and moisture regimes, a dry, nutrient-poor alpine grass heath and a wet, productive low herb meadow, changed between 1995 and 2012, in grazed and ungrazed conditions. At the grass heath, evergreen low shrub abundance had more than doubled, regardless of grazer treatment, whereas at the low herb meadow, evergreen shrubs had increased only outside exclosures while deciduous tall shrubs and forbs were significantly more abundant inside exclosures. Deciduous tall shrubs were also significantly taller in exclosures. These contrasting findings suggest that the impact of herbivores is to a great deal determined by their influence on competitive interactions between plant species, and therefore depends on the underlying composition of the plant community.

Chronologies were successfully cross-dated, and the oldest covered the period 1954-2010 (Expressed Population Signal [EPS] > 0.85,1977-2010). Distinctive pointer years, also called micro-rings, including those from a known outbreak of the irruptive moth Eurois occulta L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) that peaked in 2005, assisted in the dating process. Climate-growth analyses were performed in two ways: first, using correlation analysis between residual site-level chronologies and monthly and seasonal climate data, and second, using linear mixed effects models (LMM) with seasonal climate data and standardized chronologies for each individual. We used climate data for the current and previous years for a given growth ring for both analyses. Both analyses revealed differences in climate-growth response among species and among sites of contrasting topography. Salix ring widths from south facing slopes correlated positively with current year's summer temperatures, while those on gentle slopes associated negatively with current year's spring precipitation. Betula was only sampled at one site (flat), and displayed associations with temperature and precipitation in spring. Results from the LMM largely corroborated the correlations for Betula and Salix on south facing slopes. Salix at the flat site displayed significant associations with a large number of climate variables, most strongly previous year's summer and autumn temperatures, though precipitation in multiple seasons of the current and prior year did a better job of accounting for the variation in the data. Many dendrochronological studies in the Arctic illustrate clear summer temperature responses, but the majority were conducted on a single topographic position. Due to the heterogeneity of West Greenland's landscapes; it is important to examine individuals from varying topographies. We found that samples collected from south facing slopes do appear to respond positively to summer temperatures, while those on shallow slopes respond to a wider array of seasonal temperature and precipitation parameters. Accounting for these species and topographic differences, when sampling, is imperative for improving our understanding of how plant communities in the Arctic will respond to ongoing and expected warming.
