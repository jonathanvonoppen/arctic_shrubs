# Annual air temperature variability and biotic interactions explain tundra shrub species abundance: Data and Code Repository


## Background
This repository contains code and data for the study on drivers of shrub species abundance in the Nuuk Fjord area, Western Greenland, which is curerntly under review at *Journal of Vegetation Science* under the title **Annual air temperature variability and biotic interactions explain tundra shrub species abundance**. Data was collected by [Jacob Nabe-Nielsen](mailto:jnn@bios.au.dk) et al. during the summers of 2011-2013. Analyses were led by [Jonathan von Oppen](mailto:jonathan.vonoppen@bio.au.dk), [Anne Bjorkman](mailto:annebj@gmail.com), and [Signe Normand](mailto:signe.normand@bio.au.dk), with contributions from [Jakob Assmann](mailto:j.assmann@bio.au.dk) and [Anne Blach Overgaard](mailto:anne.overgaard@bio.au.dk).
