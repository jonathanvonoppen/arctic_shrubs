# Drivers of Shrub Abundance in Arctic Tundra: Data and Code Repository


## Background
This repository contains code and data for the study on drivers of shrub species abundance in the Nuuk Fjord area, Western Greenland, which has been submitted for publication in *Journal of Vegetation Science* under the title **Temperature variability, moisture and biotic interactions drive shrub species abundance along a coastal-inland gradient in arctic Greenland**. Data was collected by [Jacob Nabe-Nielsen](mailto:jnn@bios.au.dk) et al. during the summers of 2011-2013. Analyses were led by [Jonathan von Oppen](mailto:jonathan.vonoppen@bio.au.dk), [Anne Bjorkman](mailto:annebj@gmail.com), and [Signe Normand](mailto:signe.normand@bio.au.dk).

## File structure
The repository contains the following folders:

* [data](https://github.com/jonathanvonoppen/nuuk_shrub_drivers/tree/master/data) with the original and pre-processed data [input_data](https://github.com/jonathanvonoppen/nuuk_shrub_drivers/tree/master/data/input_data)([input_data](https://github.com/jonathanvonoppen/nuuk_shrub_drivers/tree/master/data/input_data)), including plant trait principal component scores extracted from Thomas et al. (2020), as well as cleaned model input data and model outputs ([processed](https://github.com/jonathanvonoppen/nuuk_shrub_drivers/tree/master/data/processed));

* [documentation](https://github.com/jonathanvonoppen/nuuk_shrub_drivers/tree/master/documentation) and code of the analysis workflow;

* [figures](https://github.com/jonathanvonoppen/nuuk_shrub_drivers/tree/master/figures) produced for the manuscript and supplementary material;

* [models](https://github.com/jonathanvonoppen/nuuk_shrub_drivers/tree/master/models) in JAGS code written during the analysis;

* [scripts](https://github.com/jonathanvonoppen/nuuk_shrub_drivers/tree/master/scripts) written for processing data and producing figures, sorted by the respective contributor.
