# Drivers of shrub abundance in the Nuuk Fjord area
This repository contains code and data for the study on drivers of shrub species abundance in the Nuuk Fjord area, Western Greenland. Data was collected by [Jacob Nabe-Nielsen](mailto:jnn@bios.au.dk) et al. during the summers of 2011-2013. Analyses are currently under way, led by [Jonathan von Oppen](mailto:jonathan.vonoppen@bio.au.dk) and [Signe Normand](mailto:signe.normand@bio.au.dk).
